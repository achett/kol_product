0,none,none,none,"Menopause is a universal experience for midlife women. The physiological decline in endogenous estrogen can be associated with vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes, sleep disruption, and mood disorders. Long-term concerns arise with sequelae of estrogen loss such as genitourinary syndrome of menopause and osteoporosis. Although the pendulum has swung widely since the 1942 approval of conjugated equine estrogens, estrogen therapy, now available in an ever-expanding menu of preparations, routes of administration, and dosing, remains the most effective means to collectively address these, and potentially, additional concerns. Refinement of knowledge of risks and benefits facilitates patient selection and counseling.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

34,34048742,S0014-2999(21)00360-5,Effects of neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant on hot flash-like symptoms in ovariectomized rats.,"The majority of women experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS), such as hot flashes and night sweats, during the menopausal transition. Recent evidence strongly suggests a connection between neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor signaling and VMS associated with menopause. The NK3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant is currently in phase 3 development for treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. We investigated the pharmacological effects of repeated administration of fezolinetant on levels of sex hormones and gonadotropins, neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, and skin temperature as an index of hot flash-like symptoms in ovariectomized rats as a model of menopause. Ovariectomized rats exhibited several typical menopausal symptoms: hyperphagia, increased body weight, significantly decreased plasma estradiol levels, increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and significantly increased skin temperature. Increased c-Fos expression (an indirect marker of neuronal activity) in median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) hypothalamic neurons was also observed in ovariectomized rats. Repeated oral administration of fezolinetant (1-10 mg/kg, twice daily) for 1 week dose-dependently reduced plasma LH levels without affecting estradiol or FSH levels, inhibited the activation of MnPO neurons, and attenuated hot flash-like symptoms. In addition, fezolinetant dose-dependently reduced hyperphagia and weight gain in ovariectomized rats. These preclinical findings suggest that fezolinetant attenuates hot flash-like symptoms via inhibition of neuronal activity in the MnPO of ovariectomized rats and provides further support for the ongoing clinical development of fezolinetant for the treatment of VMS associated with menopause.",2021,05,25,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,ESN364; Mechanism; Median preoptic nucleus; Menopause; Preclinical; Vasomotor symptoms,Tahara,Atsuo,"Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma Inc",atsuo.tahara@astellas.com.

Recent evidence strongly suggests a connection between neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor signaling and VMS associated with menopause. The NK3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant is currently in phase 3 development for treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. We investigated the pharmacological effects of repeated administration of fezolinetant on levels of sex hormones and gonadotropins, neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, and skin temperature as an index of hot flash-like symptoms in ovariectomized rats as a model of menopause. Ovariectomized rats exhibited several typical menopausal symptoms: hyperphagia, increased body weight, significantly decreased plasma estradiol levels, increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and significantly increased skin temperature. Increased c-Fos expression (an indirect marker of neuronal activity) in median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) hypothalamic neurons was also observed in ovariectomized rats. Repeated oral administration of fezolinetant (1-10 mg/kg, twice daily) for 1 week dose-dependently reduced plasma LH levels without affecting estradiol or FSH levels, inhibited the activation of MnPO neurons, and attenuated hot flash-like symptoms.

39,none,none,none,"Declining and variable levels of estrogens around the time of menopause are associated with a suite of metabolic, vascular, and neuroendocrine changes. The archetypal adverse effects of perimenopause are vasomotor symptoms, which include hot flashes and night sweats. Although vasomotor symptoms are routinely treated with hormone therapy, the risks associated with these treatments encourage us to seek alternative treatment avenues. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogens on temperature regulation is a first step toward identifying novel therapeutic targets. Here we outline findings in rodents that reveal neural and molecular targets of estrogens within brain regions that control distinct components of temperature homeostasis. These insights suggest that estrogens may alter the function of multiple specialized neural circuits to coordinate the suite of changes after menopause. Thus, defining the precise cells and neural circuits that mediate the effects of estrogens on temperature has promise to identify strategies that would selectively counteract hot flashes or other negative side effects without the health risks that accompany systemic hormone therapies.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Postmenopausal women management: CNGOF and GEMVi clinical practice guidelines].,"One of the major symptoms of climacteric syndrome is hot flushes (HF). They are most often experienced as very disabling. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment. However, it may be contraindicated in some women. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the scientific literature on pharmacological and non-pharmacological alternatives in this context. Only randomized trials and meta-analyses of randomized trials were considered. This review shows that some treatments usually used in non-gynecological or endocrinological disease have significant effect in reducing the frequency and/or severity of HF. Hence, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine, citalopram and escitalopram), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine) gabapentin, pregabalin and clonidine have a statistically effect as compared with placebo in reducing, the frequency and/or severity of HF. Some phytoestrogens, such as genistein, may also reduce the frequency of HF. Regarding non-pharmacological interventions, hypnosis, acupuncture or yoga have been analyzed with significant beneficial results, even if their evaluation is difficult by the absence of a good placebo group in most trials. By contrast, other approaches, both pharmacological or non-pharmacological, appear to be ineffective in the management of HT. These include homeopathy, vitamin E, alanine, omega 3, numerous phytoestrogens (red clover, black cohosh…), primrose oil, physical activity.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), the classic menopausal symptom, are linked to CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD. Evidence linking VMS to CVD events is limited. We tested whether frequent and/or persistent VMS were associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal CVD events in SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation). Methods and Results A total of 3083 women, aged 42 to 52 years at baseline, underwent up to 16 in-person visits over 22 years. Assessments included questionnaires on VMS frequency (0, 1-5, or ≥6 days/2 weeks), physical measures, phlebotomy, and reported CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and revascularization). A subset of events was adjudicated via medical record. Death certificates were obtained. Relationships between baseline VMS or persistent VMS over the follow-up (proportion of visits with frequent VMS) with combined incident nonfatal and fatal CVD were tested in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, medication use, and CVD risk factors. Participants experienced 231 CVD events over the follow-up. Women with frequent baseline VMS had an elevated risk of subsequent CVD events (relative to no VMS; ≥6 days: hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI], 1.51 [1.05-2.17], <i>P</i>=0.03; 1-5 days: HR [95% CI], 1.02 [0.75-1.39], <i>P</i>=0.89, multivariable).

176,32627593,10.1080/13697137.2020.1777965,Cognitive behavioral therapy for menopausal symptoms.,"This article describes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for women with problematic menopausal symptoms, and provides the evidence from clinical trials of women going through the menopause, women with breast cancer treatment-induced symptoms and women with problematic symptoms in a work context. The CBT focus is primarily on vasomotor symptoms (VMS) but it also targets stress, low mood and sleep problems. CBT is a brief therapy (four to six sessions) that is theory- and evidence-based; it is acceptable to women and effectively reduces the impact of VMS, improves sleep and has benefits to quality of life. VMS frequency is also reduced significantly in some trials but not others. CBT has been found to be consistently effective when delivered in groups, self-help book and on-line formats (with or without additional support). The MENOS 1 and MENOS 2 CBT protocols are recommended for the treatment of VMS by the North American Menopause Society (2015); CBT has been recommended for the treatment of anxiety and depression for women during the menopause transition and post menopause (NICE, 2015); and telephone CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for insomnia.",2020,07,06,Climacteric,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,CBT; Cognitive behavior therapy; hot flashes; hot flushes; non-hormonal treatment,Hunter,M S,"Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Guy's Campus, London, UK",none
177,33308634,S0378-5122(20)30349-2,Managing menopausal vasomotor symptoms in older women.,"This review considers the persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause-hot flashes-from the perspective of older women. Although these symptoms are most prevalent in younger women during the menopause transition and recent postmenopausal years, emerging data, corroborated by clinical experience, support the observation that for some women, VMS can remain bothersome into advanced age. Most clinical guidance focuses on treating VMS in younger women because of the concerns of increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks and possibly dementia when menopausal hormone therapies (MHT) are initiated at more advanced ages. Furthermore, recent studies into the physiology of VMS suggest a potential link with endothelial dysfunction and evidence of increased subclinical CVD and CVD events. Clinical trials have reported that older women with VMS have markedly increased CVD risk in response to oral MHT initiation compared with asymptomatic women. Nonhormonal treatment options are available for those who elect not to use, or are advised not to use, menopausal hormone therapies. As the global population ages, more research is needed to clarify the physiology of VMS in older women, suggest optimal approaches to enhance awareness of potential health risks of VMS, and recommend strategic management of VMS in older women, with the goal of promoting health and maintaining quality of life.",2020,08,26,Maturitas,Maturitas,Aging; Cardiovascular risk; Hormone therapy; Menopause; Vasomotor symptoms,Stuenkel,Cynthia A,"Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine La Jolla, CA, USA",castuenkel@ucsd.edu.

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on treatment-related symptoms among breast cancer survivors. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The authors searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE for relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for managing treatment-related symptoms published in English through June 2021. They appraised the quality of each article using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Criteria. The primary outcomes were pain, hot flashes, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, lymphedema, and neuropathy as individual symptoms. They also evaluated adverse events reported in acupuncture studies. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of 26 selected trials (2055 patients), 20 (1709 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Acupuncture was more effective than control groups in improving pain intensity [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.60, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.06 to -0.15], fatigue [SMD = -0.62, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.20], and hot flash severity [SMD = -0.52, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.22]. The subgroup analysis indicated that acupuncture showed trends but not significant effects on all the treatment-related symptoms compared with the sham acupuncture groups. Compared with waitlist control and usual care groups, the acupuncture groups showed significant reductions in pain intensity, fatigue, depression, hot flash severity, and neuropathy. No serious adverse events were reported related to acupuncture intervention. Mild adverse events (i.e., bruising, pain, swelling, skin infection, hematoma, headache, menstrual bleeding) were reported in 11 studies. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that acupuncture significantly reduces multiple treatment-related symptoms compared with the usual care or waitlist control group among breast cancer survivors. The safety of acupuncture was inadequately reported in the included studies. Based on the available data, acupuncture seems to be generally a safe treatment with some mild adverse events.

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on treatment-related symptoms among breast cancer survivors. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The authors searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE for relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for managing treatment-related symptoms published in English through June 2021. They appraised the quality of each article using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Criteria. The primary outcomes were pain, hot flashes, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, lymphedema, and neuropathy as individual symptoms. They also evaluated adverse events reported in acupuncture studies. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of 26 selected trials (2055 patients), 20 (1709 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Acupuncture was more effective than control groups in improving pain intensity [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.60, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.06 to -0.15], fatigue [SMD = -0.62, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.20], and hot flash severity [SMD = -0.52, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.22]. The subgroup analysis indicated that acupuncture showed trends but not significant effects on all the treatment-related symptoms compared with the sham acupuncture groups. Compared with waitlist control and usual care groups, the acupuncture groups showed significant reductions in pain intensity, fatigue, depression, hot flash severity, and neuropathy. No serious adverse events were reported related to acupuncture intervention. Mild adverse events (i.e., bruising, pain, swelling, skin infection, hematoma, headache, menstrual bleeding) were reported in 11 studies. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that acupuncture significantly reduces multiple treatment-related symptoms compared with the usual care or waitlist control group among breast cancer survivors. The safety of acupuncture was inadequately reported in the included studies. Based on the available data, acupuncture seems to be generally a safe treatment with some mild adverse events.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), an estrogen-inhibiting drug, can effectively inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin by pituitary gland, so as to significantly decrease the ovarian hormone level and facilitate the atrophy of ectopic endometrium, playing a positive role in preventing postoperative recurrence. The application of GnRH-a can lead to the secondary low estrogen symptoms, namely the perimenopausal symptoms, and is a main reason for patients to give up further treatment.

Anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale, and a visual analog scale. Additionally, hypnotizability was tested as a moderator of anxiety reductions.

Systematic reviews on Kuntai Capsules in the treatment of perimenopausal syndrome were retrieved from Chinese and English databases from database establishment to August 31, 2020. AMSTER-2 scale, GRADE scale and ROBIS tools were used respectively to evaluate the methodological quality, evidence quality level and bias risk of the finally included systematic reviews. A total of 6 systematic reviews with 28 outcome indicators were included. The results of AMSTER-2 methodological quality assessment showed that one of the six systematic reviews was of low quality, and the other five were of extremely low quality. GRADE scale showed that 28 clinical outcome indicators were evaluated, three of which were intermediate-level ones, and the rest were low-level or very low-level ones. Two evidences of the three intermediate evidences were total efficiency, and the other intermediate evidence was Kupperman score. ROBIS bias risk assessment showed all the included studies were of high risk. The results showed that, Kuntai Capsules were effective in the treatment of perimenopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and sweating. The improvement of E_2 level was not as good as that in the menopause hormone therapy group, but the incidence of adverse reactions was lower than that in the menopause hormone therapy group. However, the quality of evidence needs to be improved due to the low quality of methodology and high risk of bias. It is suggested that systematic review and reasonable design should be carried out in the future, and attention should be paid to the registration of research schemes. In addition, the research reports shall be prepared according to PRISMA statement.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

In hormone receptor-positive early disease, increased survival is strongly correlated with the use of adjuvant endocrine therapy, but this therapy can cause side-effects that have major consequences in terms of treatment adherence and patients' quality of life. In premenopausal breast cancer survivors, these side-effects might be even more prominent due to the abrupt suppression of oestrogen associated with the most intense endocrine therapies. An important ambition of cancer care in the 21st century is to recover pre-cancer quality of life and emotional and social functions, which is only possible through the mitigation of the side-effects of anticancer treatments.

In premenopausal breast cancer survivors, these side-effects might be even more prominent due to the abrupt suppression of oestrogen associated with the most intense endocrine therapies. An important ambition of cancer care in the 21st century is to recover pre-cancer quality of life and emotional and social functions, which is only possible through the mitigation of the side-effects of anticancer treatments. This Review presents a comprehensive summary of the efficacy and safety data of the available interventions (hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacological strategies, non-pharmacological approaches, and complementary and alternative medicine) to control selected side-effects associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy (hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, musculoskeletal symptoms, and fatigue), providing updated, evidence-based approaches for their management.",2021,04,20,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

The aim of the study was to assess the level of knowledge in pre-menopausal women on the most frequent symptoms accompanying the menopausal transition as well as conventional and nonconventional therapies of alleviating symptoms in relation to women's SES. The study was conducted among 114 women with the mean age of about 44 (± 2.51) years. A self-prepared questionnaire was used to investigate their SES and level of knowledge on the most common menopausal symptoms and methods of alleviating them. Most of the women (66.7%) were familiar with the most frequent menopausal symptoms. The women associated menopause with hot flashes (41.2%), mood swings (27.2%) and depression (15.8%). The majority of the women (84.2%) were familiar with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and 43% of them were familiar with alternative therapies (AT). Better-educated women were more likely to take AT in the future while less-educated women intended to take HRT. Place of residence and income did not differentiate whether women intended to use HRT or AT during the menopausal transition. There was no difference in the level of women's knowledge on HRT in relation to SES. There was an association between the level of knowledge on AT and education as well as place of residence.

Exogenous 17β-estradiol (E2) stimulated endothelial exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), releasing von Willebrand factor (vWF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Conversely, the estrogen antagonist ICI-182,780 interfered with E2-induced endothelial exocytosis. The ERα agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) but not the ERβ agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) induced vWF release, while ERα silencing counteracted vWF release by E2, suggesting that ERα mediates this effect. Exocytosis triggered by E2 occurred rapidly within 15 min and was not inhibited by either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. On the contrary, it was inhibited by the pre-treatment of U0126 or SB203580, an ERK or a p38 inhibitor, respectively, suggesting that E2-induced endothelial exocytosis is non-genomically mediated by the MAP kinase pathway. Finally, E2 treatment enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells ex vivo, which was interfered with the pre-treatment of ICI-182,780 or U0126.

Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of tryptophan intake as a treatment for hot flushes, asthenia, and insomnia in patients with prostate, breast, and uterine cervical cancer. Materials and methods: intervention study without a control group at the HUCA Radiation Oncology Service, from July 2018 to July 2019. A total of 60 patients with prostate, breast, or uterine cervical cancer who had received treatment with radiotherapy and hormone therapy, and who presented with hot flushes, asthenia, and insomnia were included. L-tryptophan was administered at a dose of 3 g per day. Results: a significant increase in serum tryptophan levels at the end of the study (p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in the scores of the study symptoms were reported. Although statistical significance was not found, a significant improvement in each symptom was observed, as well as an improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Conclusions: the study suggests that, in patients with breast, prostate, or uterine cervical cancer, and symptoms such as hot flushes, asthenia, and insomnia, the administration of tryptophan as a nutritional supplement is well tolerated, improves quality of life, and is associated with improvement in the scale scores of the symptoms of interest, although no statistically significant relationship with increased blood tryptophan levels was found.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is known to increase the risk of incident hypertension in adults. Although adiposity has been linked to markers of inflammation, few studies have examined these markers as potential mediators of the association between visceral adiposity and elevated blood pressure. We evaluated sociodemographic, reproductive, and lifestyle risk factors for elevated blood pressure among midlife Singaporean women. A total of 1189 women, with a mean age of 56.3 ± 6.2 years, from the Integrated Women's Health Program (IWHP) at National University Hospital, Singapore were studied. Hypothesized risk factors and levels of inflammatory markers were examined in relation to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using multivariable linear regression models. Prehypertension (SBP 120-139 mmHg and/or DBP 80-89 mmHg) and hypertension (SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg) were observed in 518 (43.6%) and 313 (26.3%) women, respectively. Compared to women in the lowest tertiles, women in the middle and upper tertiles of VAT had 7.1 (95% CI, 4.4, 9.8) mmHg and 10.2 (95% CI, 6.7, 13.7) mmHg higher adjusted SBP, respectively. Nulliparous older women with a lower education level and those with no or mild hot flashes also had a significantly higher adjusted SBP. No significant independent risk factors were observed for DBP.

Here, we determined the effects of long-term oral treatment with EGX358, a novel highly selective ERβ agonist, on memory, vasodilation, and affect in young ovariectomized mice. Mice were orally gavaged daily for 9 weeks with vehicle, 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>), the ERβ agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN), or EGX358 at doses that enhance memory when delivered acutely. Tail skin temperature was recorded as a proxy for vasodilation following injection of vehicle or senktide, a tachykinin receptor 3 agonist used to model hot flashes. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), and depression-like behavior was measured in the tail suspension (TST) and forced swim tests (FST). Finally, memory was assessed in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks.

624,33647234,10.7554/eLife.63333,Estrogen receptor alpha in the brain mediates tamoxifen-induced changes in physiology in mice.,"Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cells that mediate these negative side effects are unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA). These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression.

They can interfere with sleep, cause mood disturbances, decrease the overall quality of life, and are associated with significant health care and societal costs. This case report examines the safety and effectiveness of <i>Lepidium peruvianum</i> (maca) for the management of menopausal-related symptoms. A 32-year-old White female presented with hot flashes, night sweats, anxiety, and mood changes following a hysterectomy and oophorectomy. She was provided with a personalized nutrition plan, <i>Lepidium peruvianum</i> (maca), targeted nutrient supplementation, and lifestyle recommendations. These interventions resulted in the safe and effective resolution of hot flashes and anxiety in 2 months and significantly improved her moods and sleep.

The fever is a side effect of chemotherapy and a manifestation of cancer recurrence. The postmenopausal breast cancer patients experience another body temperature disturbance that is known as a hot flashes. Here, we reviewed the literature regarding postoperative fever and the possible underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Then the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was discussed as a therapeutic option to control postoperative fever.

741,34169801,10.1080/13697137.2021.1936485,Selective estrogen receptor modulators and bone health.,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are synthetic molecules that bind to the estrogen receptor and can have agonistic activity in some tissues while being estrogen antagonistic in others. While not all SERMs are clinically available in all parts of the world, this article will review preclinical and clinical effects of various SERMs on bone. These include tamoxifen, used as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients as well as for breast cancer prevention; raloxifene, approved for osteoporosis prevention and treatment as well as breast cancer prevention; bazedoxifene, approved for prevention of osteoporosis and also in combination with conjugated equine estrogen for treatment of vasomotor symptoms and prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal patients; and ospemifene, approved for treatment of dyspareunia due to vulvovaginal atrophy/genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Thus, these SERMs are a diverse group of estrogen agonist/antagonists that seem to have class effects in the bone and breast, although the amount of clinical trial data is quite variable. However, there does not seem to be the same unidirectional class activity in tissues like the uterus or vagina. Health-care providers should be cognizant of all available information in helping patients make the best possible shared decision-making choices.",2021,06,25,Climacteric,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,Selective estrogen receptor modulators; bone density; effects on bone; fracture,Goldstein,S R,"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA",none

While the regeneration of myofibres is well described, little is known of how the microcirculation is affected by skeletal muscle injury or its recovery during regeneration. Nevertheless, the microvasculature must also recover to restore skeletal muscle function. We aimed to define the nature of microvascular damage and time course of repair during muscle injury and regeneration induced by the myotoxin BaCl<sub>2</sub> . To test the hypothesis that microvascular disruption occurred secondary to myofibre injury, isolated microvessels were exposed to BaCl<sub>2</sub> or the myotoxin was injected into the gluteus maximus (GM) muscle of mice. In isolated microvessels, BaCl<sub>2</sub> depolarized smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells while increasing intracellular calcium in SMCs but did not elicit death of either cell type. At 1 day post-injury (dpi) of the GM, capillary fragmentation coincided with myofibre degeneration while arteriolar and venular networks remained intact; neutrophil depletion before injury did not prevent capillary damage. Perfused capillary networks reformed by 5 dpi in association with more terminal arterioles and were dilated through 10 dpi. With no change in microvascular area or branch point number in regenerating capillary networks, fewer capillaries aligned with myofibres and were no longer organized into microvascular units. By 21 dpi, capillary orientation and microvascular unit organization were no longer different from uninjured GM. We conclude that following their disruption secondary to myofibre damage, capillaries regenerate as disorganized networks that remodel into microvascular units as regenerated myofibres mature. KEY POINTS: Skeletal muscle regenerates after injury; however, the nature of microvascular damage and repair is poorly understood. Here, the myotoxin BaCl<sub>2</sub> , a standard experimental method of acute skeletal muscle injury, was used to investigate the response of the microcirculation to local injury of intact muscle.

Therefore, inhibiting oxidative stress and endothelial inflammation is important for treating hypertension. Tianma Gouteng Decoction (TGD) is a Chinese herbal medicine that is commonly used to treat hypertension in China, and demonstrates clinically effective antihypertensive effects. However, its blood pressure reduction mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we further determined the antihypertensive effects of TGD and revealed its underlying mechanism.

After six weeks, we detected changes in the structure and function of the heart, the structure of blood vessels, and vasomotor factors. We also detected the expression of oxidative stress and inflammation-related genes. We found that TGD can significantly reduce blood pressure, improve cardiac structure and function, and reverse vascular remodeling, which could be due to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation.

After six weeks, we detected changes in the structure and function of the heart, the structure of blood vessels, and vasomotor factors. We also detected the expression of oxidative stress and inflammation-related genes. We found that TGD can significantly reduce blood pressure, improve cardiac structure and function, and reverse vascular remodeling, which could be due to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. We also found that the effect of inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation could be related to the up-regulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) expression by TGD. Therefore, we used AAV9 to knock down TFEB and observe the role of TFEB in TGD's antihypertensive and cardiovascular protection properties. We found that after TFEB knockdown, the protective effect of TGD on blood pressure and cardiovascular remodeling in AngII-induced hypertensive mice was inhibited, and that it was unable to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation.

813,34944225,3448,Experimental Applications and Factors Involved in Validating Thermal Windows Using Infrared Thermography to Assess the Health and Thermostability of Laboratory Animals.,"Evaluating laboratory animals' health and thermostability are fundamental components of all experimental designs. Alterations in either one of these parameters have been shown to trigger physiological changes that can compromise the welfare of the species and the replicability and robustness of the results obtained. Due to the nature and complexity of evaluating and managing the species involved in research protocols, non-invasive tools such as infrared thermography (IRT) have been adopted to quantify these parameters without altering them or inducing stress responses in the animals. IRT technology makes it possible to quantify changes in surface temperatures that are derived from alterations in blood flow that can result from inflammatory, stressful, or pathological processes; changes can be measured in diverse regions, called thermal windows, according to their specific characteristics.

839,34860357,10.1007/s40119-021-00247-1,The Role of Ivabradine in Managing Symptomatic Patients with Chronic Coronary Syndromes: A Clinically Oriented Approach.,"Angina is a significant contributor to disability and impairment in quality of life in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). An elevated heart rate (HR) may trigger myocardial ischemia by increasing oxygen consumption and decreasing the diastolic time, compromising the coronary flow. HR-lowering strategies offer symptom control and prevent cardiovascular events in subgroups of patients with CCS. However, the best therapeutic approach to achieve the desired HR in patients with CCS can be challenging based on efficacy and tolerability. Guidelines usually propose β-blockers and/or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) for angina patients with elevated HR. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence of greater antianginal efficacy of this strategy versus an alternative HR-lowering agent. Ivabradine reduces the HR by blocking the I<sub>f</sub> current in the sinoatrial node without affecting myocardial contractility or vascular tone. The magnitude of the HR reduction by ivabradine is proportional to the initial HR, which decreases the risk of significant bradycardia. Ivabradine increases the diastolic time and the coronary flow reserve to a greater extent than β-blockers and favors collateralization, improving the regional blood flow. We present two clinical cases of patients with symptomatic CCS in whom HR control with ivabradine was fundamental for symptom control and improvement in left ventricular (LV) function. An earlier combination of ivabradine plus β-blockers would have provided more rapid symptom control and improved LV function in the first case. In the second case, the primary mechanism responsible for angina was most likely a coronary vasomotor abnormality, in which the use of β-blockers aggravated the discomfort. The combination of a dihydropyridine CCB plus ivabradine was highly influential in symptom control. Due to its effects beyond HR reduction and good tolerability, ivabradine should be considered an essential ally in managing patients with angina and high HR with or without LV dysfunction.",2021,12,03,Cardiol Ther,Cardiology and therapy,Angina; Chronic coronary syndromes; Heart rate; Ivabradine; Symptomatic; Treatment,Gowdak,Luis Henrique W,"Heart Institute (InCor-HCFMUSP), Av",luis.gowdak@incor.usp.br.
840,none,none,none,"Non-invasive Doppler ultrasonographic study of cerebral arteries (transcranial Doppler, TCD) has been extensively applied on both outpatient and inpatient settings. It is performed placing a low-frequency (≤2 MHz) transducer on the scalp of the patient over specific acoustic windows, in order to visualize the intracranial arterial vessels and to evaluate the cerebral blood flow velocity and its alteration in many different conditions. Nowadays a valid indication for TCD in the outpatient setting is the research of right-to-left shunting, responsible for the so-called ""paradoxical embolism"", most often due to patency of foramen ovale, which is responsible for the majority of cryptogenic strokes occurring in patients younger than 55 years. TCD also allows to classify the grade of severity of such shunts using the so-called ""microembolic signal grading score"". Therefore, TCD is an essential cardiological exam for the detection of patent foramen ovale, assuming an important role as a first-level examination to guide the subsequent diagnostic-therapeutic management. In addition, TCD has found many useful applications in neurocritical care practice. It is useful for the identification of intracranial vascular stenosis and for the assessment of critical conditions including vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury and brain stem death. It is also used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic changes after stroke, to investigate cerebral pressure autoregulation, and for the clinical evaluation of cerebral vasomotor reactivity.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Insomnia is the most common and is recognised as a core symptom of the menopause. Guidelines to support decision making for women with sleep problems during the menopausal transition are lacking. Sleep problems are associated with negative impacts on healthcare utilisation, quality of life and work productivity. Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Declining oestrogen is implicated as a cause of menopausal sleep disruption. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and menopausal mood disturbance are also factors in the complex aetiology. VMS commonly precipitate insomnia and, due to their prolonged duration, they often perpetuate the condition. Insomnia in the general population is most effectively treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (also effective in the menopausal transition.) The associations of menopausal sleep disturbance with VMS and depression mean that other treatment options must be considered. Existing guidelines outline effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), CBT and antidepressants. HRT may indirectly help with sleep disturbance by treating VMS and also via beneficial effect on mood symptoms.

However, the origin of these spinal angiotensinergic inputs remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of spinal angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) receptors in the sympathoexcitatory responses evoked by the activation of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in control and 2K1C Goldblatt rats. Hypertension was induced by clipping of the left renal artery. After 6 weeks, a catheter (PE-10) filled with losartan was inserted into the subarachnoid space and advanced to the T10-11 vertebral level in urethane-anesthetized rats. The effects of glutamate microinjection into the RVLM on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and renal and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA and sSNA, respectively) were evaluated in the presence or absence of spinal AT1 blockade. Tachycardic, pressor, and renal sympathoexcitatory effects caused by RVLM activation were significantly blunted by losartan in 2K1C rats, but not in control rats. However, no differences were found in the gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, and renin in the spinal cord segments between the groups. In conclusion, acute sympathoexcitation induced by RVLM activation is dependent on the spinal AT1 receptor in Goldblatt, but not in control, rats.

The NA cumulative concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in parallel with phentolamine (an α-antagonist). However, propranolol, a β-antagonist, had no significant effect. The 5-HT curve was shifted to the right in parallel by ketanserin (a 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonist) and methiothepin (a 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonist). Losartan (an AT<sub>1</sub> antagonist) shifted the Ang II curve to the right, whereas PD123319 (an AT<sub>2</sub> antagonist) had no significant effect. L-NA, indomethacin, and des-Arg<sup>9</sup>-[Leu<sup>8</sup>]-BK (a B<sub>1</sub> antagonist) did not significantly affect BK-induced contractions. HOE140 (a B<sub>2</sub> antagonist) shifted the BK concentration-response curve to the right. The His curve was shifted to the right weakly by diphenhydramine (an H<sub>1</sub> antagonist) and strongly by cimetidine (a H<sub>2</sub> antagonist). ACh-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by L-NA, atropine, and pFHHSiD (a muscarinic M<sub>3</sub> antagonist), whereas pirenzepine and methoctramine (muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> antagonists, respectively) showed no significant effects. At a resting vascular tone, L-NA-induced contraction and indomethacin induced relaxation. These results suggest that α-adrenergic, 5-HT<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, AT<sub>1</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub> receptors might be important in arterial contraction, whereas M<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> (>H<sub>1</sub>) receptors might modify these contractions, inducing relaxation.",2021,09,15,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

This study reports a technique that could diagnose and differentiate PD from essential tremor (ET) in its earlier stage using a non-motor phenotype. Autonomic dysfunction, an early symptom in PD patients, is caused by α-synuclein pathogenesis in the central nervous system and can be diagnosed using skin vasomotor response to cold stimuli. In this study, the investigations were performed using data collected from 20 PD, 20 ET and 20 healthy subjects. Infrared thermography was used for the cold stress test to observe subjects' hand temperature before and after cold stimuli. The results show that the recovery rate of hand temperature was significantly different between the groups. The data obtained in the cold stress test were verified using Pearson's cross-correlation technique, which showed that few disease parameters like medication and motor rating score had an impact on the recovery rate of hand temperature in PD subjects. The characteristics of the three groups were compared and classified using the k-means clustering algorithm.

1031,none,none,none,"Research has shown that transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation (tcVNS) yields downstream changes in peripheral physiology in individuals afflicted with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While the cardiovascular effects of tcVNS have been studied broadly in prior work, the specific effects of tcVNS on the reciprocal of the pulse transit time (1/PTT) remain unknown. By quantifying detectable effects, tcVNS can be further evaluated as a counterbalance to sympathetic hyperactivity during distress - specifically, we hypothesized that tcVNS would inhibit 1/PTT responses to traumatic stress. To investigate this, the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and seismocardiogram (SCG), were simultaneously measured from 24 human subjects suffering from PTSD. Implementing state-of-the-art signal quality assessment algorithms, relative changes in the pulse arrival time (PAT) and the pre-ejection period (PEP) were estimated solely from signal segments of sufficient quality. Thereby computing relative changes in 1/PTT, we find that tcVNS results in reduced 1/PTT responses to traumatic stress and the first minute of stimulation, compared to a sham control (corrected p < 0.05). This suggests that tcVNS induces inhibitory effects on blood pressure (BP) and/or vasoconstriction, given the established relationship between 1/PTT and these parameters.Clinical Relevance- Relative changes in 1/PTT are induced by varying vasomotor tone and/or BP - it has therefore piqued considerable interest as a potential surrogate of continuous BP. Studying its responses to tcVNS thus furthers understanding of tcVNS-induced cardiovascular modulation. The positive effects detailed herein suggest a potential role for tcVNS in the long-term management of PTSD.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

ANOCA patients, especially those with underlying coronary vascular dysfunction, have an adverse cardiovascular prognosis, poor physical functioning, and a reduced quality of life. Since standard ischemia detection tests and coronary angiograms are not designed to diagnose coronary vascular dysfunction, this ischemic heart disease is often overlooked and hence undertreated. But adequate diagnosis is vital, so that treatment can be started to reduce symptoms, reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life and cardiovascular prognosis. The purpose of this review is to give a contemporary overview of ANOCA with focus on coronary vascular dysfunction. We will provide a possible work-up of patients suspected of coronary vascular dysfunction in the outpatient clinical setting, based on the latest scientific insights and international consensus documents.

Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

They exert a negative impact on a woman's physical and mental well-being and are considered a high clinical priority requiring effective treatment.

Methods and Results A total of 206 patients from 4 randomized trials treated with the durable-polymer everolimus-eluting Xience (n=44), bioresorbable-polymer sirolimus-eluting Orsiro (n=35), polymer-free biolimus-eluting Biofreedom (n=24), bioactive endothelial-progenitor cell-capturing sirolimus-eluting Combo DES (n=25), polymer-based everolimus-eluting Absorb (n=44), and Mg-based sirolimus-eluting Magmaris BRS (n=34) underwent endothelium-dependent vasomotor tests and optical coherence tomography imaging, as per protocol, at follow-up. Crude vasomotor responses of distal segments to low-dose acetylcholine (10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L) were different between groups: bioresorbablepolymer DEShad the worst (-8.4%±12.6%) and durable-polymer DES had the most physiologic (-0.4%±11.8%; <i>P</i>=0.014). High-dose acetylcholine (10<sup>-4</sup> mol/L) showed similar responses between groups (ranging from -10.8%±11.6% to -18.1%±15.4%; <i>P</i>=0.229). Device healing was different between devices. Uncovered struts ranged from 6.3%±7.1% (bioresorbable-polymer DES) to 2.5%±4.5% (bioactive DES; <i>P</i>=0.056). In multivariate models, endothelium-dependent vasomotor response was associated with age, bioresorbable-polymer DES, and angiographic lumen loss, but not with strut coverage nor plaque type. Endothelial dysfunction (defined as ≥4% vasoconstriction) was observed in 46.6% of patients with low-dose and 68.9% with high-dose acetylcholine, without differences between groups.

1137,34547277,S0006-3495(21)00787-6,Red blood cells under flow show maximal ATP release for specific hematocrit.,"ATP release by red blood cells (RBCs) under shear stress (SS) plays a pivotal role in endothelial biochemical signaling cascades. The aim of this study is to investigate through numerical simulation how RBC spatiotemporal organization depends on flow and geometrical conditions to generate ATP patterns. Numerical simulations were conducted in a straight channel by considering both plasma and explicit presence of RBCs, their shape deformation and cell-cell interaction, and ATP release by RBCs. Two ATP release pathways through cell membrane are taken into account: pannexin 1 channel, sensitive to SS, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which responds to cell deformation. Several flow and hematocrit conditions are explored. The problem is solved by the lattice Boltzmann method. Application of SS to the RBC suspension triggers a nontrivial spatial RBC organization and ATP patterns. ATP localizes preferentially in the vicinity of the cell-free layer close to channel wall. Conditions for maximal ATP release per cell are identified, which depend on vessel size and hematocrit Ht. Increasing further Ht beyond optimum enhances the total ATP release but should degrade oxygen transport capacity, a compromise between an efficient ATP release and minimal blood dissipation. Moreover, ATP is boosted in capillaries, suggesting a vasomotor activity coordination throughout the resistance network.",2021,09,20,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,none,Gou,Zhe,"Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LIPhy, Grenoble, France",none

1139,34547277,S0006-3495(21)00787-6,Red blood cells under flow show maximal ATP release for specific hematocrit.,"ATP release by red blood cells (RBCs) under shear stress (SS) plays a pivotal role in endothelial biochemical signaling cascades. The aim of this study is to investigate through numerical simulation how RBC spatiotemporal organization depends on flow and geometrical conditions to generate ATP patterns. Numerical simulations were conducted in a straight channel by considering both plasma and explicit presence of RBCs, their shape deformation and cell-cell interaction, and ATP release by RBCs. Two ATP release pathways through cell membrane are taken into account: pannexin 1 channel, sensitive to SS, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which responds to cell deformation. Several flow and hematocrit conditions are explored. The problem is solved by the lattice Boltzmann method. Application of SS to the RBC suspension triggers a nontrivial spatial RBC organization and ATP patterns. ATP localizes preferentially in the vicinity of the cell-free layer close to channel wall. Conditions for maximal ATP release per cell are identified, which depend on vessel size and hematocrit Ht. Increasing further Ht beyond optimum enhances the total ATP release but should degrade oxygen transport capacity, a compromise between an efficient ATP release and minimal blood dissipation.

1143,34343735,S0196-0709(21)00266-0,Using thermal effect of 970 nm diode laser to reduce nasal swell body.,"In recent decades, semiconductor lasers have been successfully used in rhinology. However, their usage in the reduction of the nasal swell body (NSB) is barely studied. Our research aimed to conduct an experimental selection of the laser exposure mode in the NSB zone using a 970 nm diode laser for safe and effective NSB reduction. The thermometric parameters of a diode laser with a wavelength of 970 nm were evaluated in a continuous contact mode of exposure at the power from 2 W to 10 W with 2 W step. The laser was targeted at the liver of cattle, given its similar optical properties to the NSB region. After a series of experiments with every power rate and the analysis of temperature data, we estimated an optimal exposure mode at a power of 4 W. The collected thermometric data demonstrate the safety of this mode in a clinical setting for NSB reduction due to causing no thermal damage to the adjacent tissue. Based on the experiment, a technique for laser reduction of the NSB was developed to improve nasal breathing in patients with severe hypertrophy of this area. The proposed technique was applied to 39 patients with chronic vasomotor rhinitis and the NSB. All patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who underwent surface contact laser-turbinectomy and the NSB reduction using a 970 nm diode laser. Group 2 included 19 patients with the same pathology who underwent laser-turbinectomy, without reduction of the NSB. No statistically significant difference was observed during the dynamic observation with an objective assessment of nasal respiration according to active anterior rhinomanometry when comparing these subgroups with each other according to the t-criterion for independent samples (p > 0.05). As a result of comparing the data obtained on the NOSE scale using the Student's t-test, a statistically significant difference is observed (p < 0.001). Thus, patients who did not perform the reduction of the NSB subjectively noted the insufficiency of nasal breathing.

We have previously reported that MAO-related oxidative stress mediates endothelial dysfunction in rodent models of diabetes and diabetic patients; however, the role of MAO in the vascular impairment associated to obesity has not been investigated so far. Metformin (METF), the first-line drug in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been reported to elicit vasculoprotective effects via partially elucidated mechanisms. The present study was purported to assess the effects of METF on MAO expression, ROS production and vasomotor function of aortas isolated from rats with diet-induced obesity. After 24 weeks of high calorie junk food (HCJF) diet, isolated aortic rings were prepared and treated with METF (10 μM, 12 h incubation). Measurements of MAO expression (quantitative PCR and immune histochemistry), ROS production (spectrometry and immune-fluorescence) and vascular reactivity (myograph studies) were performed in rat aortic rings. MAO expression was upregulated in aortic rings isolated from obese rats together with an increase in ROS production and an impairment of vascular reactivity.

Additionally, it is possible that PEH mechanisms are not consistent in each individual (i.e. within-individual variation), which has not been investigated yet. Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess the within-individual consistency of PEH hemodynamic and autonomic mechanisms. For that, 30 subjects performed 4 sessions divided in 2 blocks (test and retest). In each block, an exercise (cycling, 45 min, 50%VO<sub>2</sub>peak) and a control (seated rest, 45 min) session was randomly conducted. Blood pressure (BP) and its mechanisms were evaluated pre- and post-interventions. In each block, individual responses were calculated as post-exercise minus post-control, and a response was considered present when its magnitude reached the typical error of the measurement. Consistencies were evaluated by comparing test and retest responses through kappa coefficient (k). PEH consistency was calculated using role sample, while mechanisms consistency was evaluated in those with consistent PEH. Twenty-one (70%) participants showed consistent PEH, 5 (17%) presented PEH in only test or retest and 4 (13%) had absent PEH response, characterising a good consistency (k = 0.510). Regarding mechanisms' responses, good consistency was found for heart rate (k = 0.456), sympathovagal balance (k = 0.438), and baroreflex sensitivity (k = 0.458); while systemic vascular resistance (k = 0.152), cardiac output (k = -0.400), stroke volume (k = -0.055), and sympathetic vasomotor modulation (k = -0.096) presented marginal consistencies.

1179,34816248,10.3389/fgwh.2021.744748,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Sexual Concerns During Perimenopause: A Four Session Study Protocol.,"<b>Background:</b> During the menopausal transition, women often experience physical (e.g., vasomotor symptoms) and emotional (e.g., anxiety and depression) difficulties that significantly impact functioning and overall quality of life. Although sexual concerns (e.g., decreased sexual desire, orgasm), are reported by up to 87% of peri- and post-menopausal women, and are associated with adverse impact on functioning and distress, treatment options that directly target this area are limited, and most often involve medication (e.g., hormone replacement). Effectiveness of these treatments is often defined as improvements in physical symptoms, however, associated psychological and emotional symptoms rarely, if at all, improve. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proposed as a low-risk treatment for menopausal symptoms with studies showing improvement in frequently reported symptoms (e.g., vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, sleep). Sexual concerns, however, have either not been directly targeted at all in current CBT protocols, or the very few protocols that include sexual concerns, demonstrated modest gains in sexual desire. <b>Methods:</b> This protocol paper outlines the development, design, and implementation of a newly developed CBT for sexual concerns trial during perimenopause (CBT-SC-Peri). Although sexual concerns are prevalent during both the peri- and post-menopausal periods, we will be evaluating the effectiveness of a CBT-SC protocol specifically for perimenopausal women as a means of early intervention. The clinical sample will comprise 82 women aged 40-60 years currently in perimenopause, as per the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) definition, and medication stable (if applicable). To ensure participants are experiencing clinically significant sexual concerns, a baseline cut-off score of 26 or lower on the Female Sexual Functioning Index will be utilized. Exclusion criteria include participants with psychotic disorders, or current substance and/or alcohol dependence, or severely depressed/suicidal. The CBT-SC-Peri is a weekly, four session treatment, lasting up to 90 min per session and includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavioral strategies designed to challenge unhelpful beliefs and promote healthy sexual behaviors. As this is an individual CBT protocol, content will be tailored to address the specific problems relevant for each participant. Eligible women will be placed directly into treatment or on a 4-week waitlist and reassessed prior to starting treatment. The primary outcome (sexual satisfaction), as well as secondary outcomes (desire, arousal, relationship satisfaction, body image, vasomotor symptoms, depression, and anxiety) are assessed at baseline, post-waitlist (for those on waitlist), and post-treatment. <b>Discussion:</b> To our knowledge, this will be the first study to investigate the efficacy of a CBT protocol (CBT-SC-Peri) specifically aimed at improving sexual concerns experienced during perimenopause. If effective, this form of treatment may not only be preferred by some, but necessary for others as consumer demand increases for non-pharmacological treatments for perimenopausal symptoms. Further, this protocol can be integrated into perimenopausal care and will be made available by dissemination to healthcare practitioners. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Trial # NCT04922385 and Accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04922385?term=NCT04922385anddraw=2andrank=1.",2021,10,06,Front Glob Womens Health,Frontiers in global women's health,cognitive behavioral therapy; non-pharmacological management; perimenopause; psychological; sexual concerns,Green,Sheryl M,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada",none

The primary outcome (sexual satisfaction), as well as secondary outcomes (desire, arousal, relationship satisfaction, body image, vasomotor symptoms, depression, and anxiety) are assessed at baseline, post-waitlist (for those on waitlist), and post-treatment. <b>Discussion:</b> To our knowledge, this will be the first study to investigate the efficacy of a CBT protocol (CBT-SC-Peri) specifically aimed at improving sexual concerns experienced during perimenopause. If effective, this form of treatment may not only be preferred by some, but necessary for others as consumer demand increases for non-pharmacological treatments for perimenopausal symptoms. Further, this protocol can be integrated into perimenopausal care and will be made available by dissemination to healthcare practitioners. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Trial # NCT04922385 and Accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04922385?term=NCT04922385anddraw=2andrank=1.",2021,10,06,Front Glob Womens Health,Frontiers in global women's health,cognitive behavioral therapy; non-pharmacological management; perimenopause; psychological; sexual concerns,Furtado,Melissa,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada",none

Thus, our objective was to test the hypothesis that reductions in SIRT6 elicit endothelial dysfunction in young, genetically altered mice. <b>Results and Approach:</b> We used young (3 month old), littermate-matched, SIRT6 wild-type (WT), and SIRT6 heterozygous (HET) mice. SIRT6 expression (qRT-PCR) was reduced by 50% in HET mice. Carotid vessel responses to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, U46619, and serotonin were examined in isolated organ chamber baths. Relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACH) was impaired in HET mice compared to littermate-matched WT controls (67 ± 3% versus 76 ± 3%, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.05), while responses to sodium nitroprusside were unchanged. Short-term incubation of carotid rings with the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, significantly improved in vessels from HET mice but not their WT littermates. Peak tension generated in response to either U46619 or serotonin was significantly blunted in HET mice compared to their WT littermates. <b>Conclusion:</b> These data suggest that SIRT6 is a key regulator of vasomotor function in conduit vessels. More specifically, we propose that SIRT6 serves as a tonic suppressor of NAD(P)H oxidase expression and activation, as inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase improved endothelial function in SIRT6 haploinsufficient mice. Collectively, SIRT6 activation and/or histone acetyltransferase inhibition may be useful therapeutic approaches to reduce endothelial dysfunction and combat age-associated cardiovascular disease.",2021,10,20,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,aging; endothelial dysfunction; histone deacetylation; sirtuin 6; vascular function,Greiten,Lawrence E,"Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States",none

Approximately 70% of patients with angina and suspected myocardial ischaemia show no signs of obstructed coronary arteries after coronary angiography, but may still demonstrate ischaemia. Ischaemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) is increasingly acknowledged as a serious condition because of its association with poor quality of life and elevated risk for cardiovascular events. The negative effects of psychological stress on INOCA are gaining more attention. Psychological stress is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia. Psychological stress includes anxiety, depression, anger and personality disturbances. Coronary microvascular dysfunction and coronary arterial spasm are phenotypes of coronary vasomotor disorders that are triggered by psychological distress and depression, thereby increasing cardiovascular disease risk. Coronary vasomotor disorders are often co-existent in INOCA patients and might be considered as a contributing factor to mental stress-associated adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, psychological stress induces endothelial dysfunction more often in (young) women with INOCA than in men. Overall, many studies demonstrate an association between mental stress, coronary microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm in patients with INOCA - especially women. Future research on stress-reducing therapies that target coronary vasomotor disorders in patients with INOCA is needed.

Considering that the retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rWAT) is an important fat visceral depot and receives intense sympathetic and afferent innervations, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects evoked by bilateral rWAT denervation in obese rats. Male Wistar rats were fed with HFD for 8 consecutive weeks and rWAT denervation was performed at the 6th week. Arterial pressure, splanchnic and renal sympathetic vasomotor nerve activities were assessed and inflammation and the components of the renin -angiotensin system were evaluated in different white adipose tissue depots. HFD animals presented higher serum levels of leptin and glucose, an increase in arterial pressure and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity; rWAT denervation, normalized these parameters. Pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were significantly increased, as well as RAAS gene expression in WAT of HFD animals; rWAT denervation significantly attenuated these changes. In conclusion, HFD promotes vasomotor sympathetic overactivation and inflammation with repercussions on the cardiovascular system.

Nitric oxide (NO) is mainly produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on the membrane of endothelial cells (ECs) in the cardiovascular system and plays an important role in vasomotor function. It strongly inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ameliorates endothelial function when ECs get hurt. Inspired by this, introducing NO to traditional stent coating may alleviate endothelial insufficiency caused by rapamycin. Here, we introduced SNAP as the NO donor, mimicking how NO affects <i>in vivo</i>, into rapamycin coating to alleviate endothelial damage while inhibiting SMC proliferation. Through wicking effects, SNAP was absorbed into a hierarchical coating that had an upper porous layer and a dense polymer layer with rapamycin at the bottom. Cells were cultured on the coatings, and it was observed that the injured ECs were restored while the growth of SMCs further diminished. Genome analysis was conducted to further clarify possible signaling pathways: the effect of cell growth attenuated by NO may cause by affecting cell cycle and enhancing inflammation.

Hormone therapy (HT) for the relief of menopausal symptoms has been the object of much controversy over the past two decades. At the beginning of the century, a shadow was cast on the use of HT owing to the concern for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks, and breast cancer, arising following publication of a large randomized placebo-controlled trial.

1307,none,none,none,"Microvascular angina (MVA) is a condition characterized by the presence of angina-like chest pain, a positive response to exercise stress tests, and no significant stenosis of coronary arteries in coronary angiography, with absence of any other specific cardiac diseases. The etiology of this syndrome is still not known and it is probably multifactorial. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is proposed as the main pathophysiological mechanism in the development of MVA. Altered somatic and visceral pain perception and autonomic imbalance, in addition to myocardial ischemia, has been observed in subjects with MVA, involving dynamic variations in the vasomotor tone of coronary microcirculation with consequent transient ischemic episodes. Other theories suggest that MVA may be a result of a chronic inflammatory state in the body that can negatively influence the endothelium or a local imbalance of factors regulating its function. This article presents the latest information about the epidemiology, diagnostics, etiopathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with MVA.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

However, it is unclear whether PKC activation, without activating the contractile machinery, can lead to coronary arteriolar dysfunction. The vasoconstriction induced by the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) was examined in isolated porcine coronary arterioles. The PDBu-evoked vasoconstriction was sensitive to a broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor but not affected by inhibiting PKCβ2 or Rho kinase. After exposure of the vessels to a sub-vasomotor concentration of PDBu (1 nmol/L, 60 min), the endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-mediated dilations in response to serotonin and adenosine were compromised but the dilation induced by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was unaltered. PDBu elevated superoxide production, which was blocked by the superoxide scavenger Tempol. The impaired NO-mediated vasodilations were reversed by Tempol or inhibition of PKCβ2, xanthine oxidase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Rho kinase but were not affected by a hydrogen peroxide scavenger or inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase and p38 kinase. The PKCβ2 protein was detected in the arteriolar wall and co-localized with endothelial NO synthase.

1312,34558670,10.1002/cphy.c200028,Regulation of the Cerebral Circulation During Development.,"The cerebral microcirculation undergoes dynamic changes in parallel with the development of neurons, glia, and their energy metabolism throughout gestation and postnatally. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen consumption, and glucose consumption are as low as 20% of adult levels in humans born prematurely but eventually exceed adult levels at ages 3 to 11 years, which coincide with the period of continued brain growth, synapse formation, synapse pruning, and myelination. Neurovascular coupling to sensory activation is present but attenuated at birth. By 2 postnatal months, the increase in CBF often is disproportionately smaller than the increase in oxygen consumption, in contrast to the relative hyperemia seen in adults. Vascular smooth muscle myogenic tone increases in parallel with developmental increases in arterial pressure. CBF autoregulatory response to increased arterial pressure is intact at birth but has a more limited range with arterial hypotension. Hypoxia-induced vasodilation in preterm fetal sheep with low oxygen consumption does not sustain cerebral oxygen transport, but the response becomes better developed for sustaining oxygen transport by term. Nitric oxide tonically inhibits vasomotor tone, and glutamate receptor activation can evoke its release in lambs and piglets. In piglets, astrocyte-derived carbon monoxide plays a central role in vasodilation evoked by glutamate, ADP, and seizures, and prostanoids play a large role in endothelial-dependent and hypercapnic vasodilation. Overall, homeostatic mechanisms of CBF regulation in response to arterial pressure, neuronal activity, carbon dioxide, and oxygenation are present at birth but continue to develop postnatally as neurovascular signaling pathways are dynamically altered and integrated. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

It is characterized by typical clinical findings such as severe and disabling pain disproportionate to the injury, functional limitations, as well as sensory and vasomotor alterations. However, some people do not report any injury associated with algodystrophy onset in personal history. We describe the management of an unusual case of CRPS I which occurred during the long-term follow-up of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and performed a narrative review of algodystrophy in non-orthopedic surgery. A clinical case of a 44-year-old man with a spontaneous onset of CRPS I of the right ankle is presented. He did not refer to history of any memorable significant trigger event. Approximately 5 months before the onset of clinical manifestations, he received a PTCA via the right femoral approach. We suppose an association between CRPS and this procedure and propose a possible pathophysiologic mechanism. The patient was treated with intramuscular neridronate, which resulted in significant pain relief and improved his quality of life. A comprehensive clinical and instrumental evaluation in patients with CRPS is challenging but mandatory for a correct diagnosis. An extensive analysis of patient history is important for identifying any potential trigger event, including non-orthopedic procedures. Bone scan could have a pivotal role for improving diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in CRPS I. Neridronate was a safe and effective therapeutic approach for this patient, confirming the results of the high-quality evidence available.",2021,09,01,Diagnostics (Basel),"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",angioplasty; balloon; complex regional pain syndromes; coronary; diphosphonates; neridronate; reflex sympathetic dystrophy,Iolascon,Giovanni,"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties and Dentistry, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy",none

1369,none,none,none,"Although commonly thought to produce prostacyclin (prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> ; PGI<sub>2</sub> ) that evokes vasodilatation and protects vessels from the development of diseases, the endothelial cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated metabolism has also been found to release substance(s) called endothelium-derived contracting factor(s) (EDCF) that causes endothelium-dependent contraction and implicates in endothelial dysfunction of disease conditions. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the process; however, the major endothelial COX metabolite PGI<sub>2</sub> , which has been classically considered to activate the I prostanoid receptor (IP) that mediates vasodilatation and opposes the effects of thromboxane (Tx) A<sub>2</sub> produced by COX in platelets, emerges as a major EDCF in health and disease conditions. Our recent studies from genetically altered mice further suggest that vasomotor reactions to PGI<sub>2</sub> are collectively modulated by IP, the vasoconstrictor Tx-prostanoid receptor (TP; the prototype receptor of TxA<sub>2</sub> ) and E prostanoid receptor-3 (EP3; a vasoconstrictor receptor of PGE<sub>2</sub> ) although with differences in potency and efficacy; a contraction to PGI<sub>2</sub> reflects activities of TP and/or EP3 outweighing that of the concurrently activated IP. Here, we discuss the history of endothelium-dependent contraction, evidences that support the above hypothesis, proposed mechanisms for the varied reactions to endothelial PGI<sub>2</sub> synthesis as well as the relation of its dilator activity to the effect of another NO-independent vasodilator mechanism, the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Also, we address the possible pathological and therapeutic implications as well as questions remaining to be resolved or limitations of our above findings obtained from genetically altered mouse models.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Over the years, many pharmacotherapeutic options have been tested, and others are still being developed. Hormone therapy (HT) is the most efficient therapy for managing vasomotor symptoms and related disturbances. The term HT comprises estrogens and progestogens, androgens, tibolone, the tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC), a combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, and the selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as ospemifene. Estrogens and progestogens and androgens may differ significantly for chemical structure and can be delivered through different routes, thereby displaying various pharmacological and clinical properties. Tibolone, TSEC and SERM also exhibit unique pharmacodynamics that can be exploited to obtain distinctive therapeutic effects. Non-hormonal options fall mainly into the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), GABA-analogue drug classes.<b>Areas covered</b>: Herein, the authors describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hormonal (androgens, estrogens, progestogens, tibolone, TSEC, SERMs) and non-hormonal (SSRIs, SNRIs, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Oxybutynin, Neurokinin antagonists) treatments for menopausal symptoms and report essential clinical trial data in humans.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Patient tailoring of treatment is key to managing symptoms of menopause.

This cross-sectional study included rural perimenopausal/postmenopausal women. Demographic (age, marital status, and education and employment status), physical (body weight and height), medical (chronic disease status), obstetric (number of gravidas), and menopausal characteristics (menopausal nature, perception of menopause, and menopausal stage), physical activity level, anxiety and depressive symptom levels, MSS, and MSQoL of the participants were assessed. The relationships between MSS/MSQoL and all individual characteristics were examined by correlation analyses. In addition, MSS and MSQoL were compared between various categories using independent-groups t tests and variance analyses. Statistical significance level was set at p <0.05. A total of 245 women (mean age 56.64 ± 6.59 years) were included in the study. It was found that marital status, body mass index, presence of chronic disease, the number of gravidas, perception of menopause, and anxiety and depressive symptom levels were associated with MSS and MSQoL (p < 0.05). On the other hand, symptom severity and QoL did not change according to the level of education, employment status, menopausal nature, menopausal stage, and physical activity level (p > 0.05).

Demographic (age, marital status, and education and employment status), physical (body weight and height), medical (chronic disease status), obstetric (number of gravidas), and menopausal characteristics (menopausal nature, perception of menopause, and menopausal stage), physical activity level, anxiety and depressive symptom levels, MSS, and MSQoL of the participants were assessed. The relationships between MSS/MSQoL and all individual characteristics were examined by correlation analyses. In addition, MSS and MSQoL were compared between various categories using independent-groups t tests and variance analyses. Statistical significance level was set at p <0.05. A total of 245 women (mean age 56.64 ± 6.59 years) were included in the study. It was found that marital status, body mass index, presence of chronic disease, the number of gravidas, perception of menopause, and anxiety and depressive symptom levels were associated with MSS and MSQoL (p < 0.05). On the other hand, symptom severity and QoL did not change according to the level of education, employment status, menopausal nature, menopausal stage, and physical activity level (p > 0.05). MSS and MSQoL in rural women may be associated or affected by a wide range of individual characteristics, and this relationship or influence differs from the urban women literature at some points. Further studies are needed to illuminate the menopausal process in rural areas and compare rural and urban results.",2021,03,22,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",Anxiety; Demographic features; Depression; Perimenopausal period; Physical activity level; Vasomotor symptoms,Özgül,Serap,"Institute of Health Sciences, Division of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey",serapky@yahoo.com.

Sympathetic activity and vascular function, which are key factors in the pathophysiology and prognosis of cardiovascular disease, are linked by a close relationship. Evidence from experimental studies indicates that the sympathetic nervous system is critically influenced, at the central and also at the peripheral level, by the most relevant factors regulating vascular function, namely nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species and endothelin. Additionally, there is evidence of a reciprocal influence between endothelial function and sympathetic mechanisms.

Patients afflicted with this condition suffer from pain in their hands and feet, with vasomotor changes including flushing and redness to the distal upper and lower extremities. Current treatment modalities for this condition include pharmacological therapies (neuropathic medications), behavioural interventions, lumbar epidural infusions with local anaesthetics and sympathetic nerve blocks.

1458,none,none,none,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease of the cardiopulmonary system that lacks curative treatments. The main pathological event in PAH is elevated vascular resistance in the pulmonary circulation, caused by abnormal vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling. Ion channels are key determinants of vascular smooth muscle tone and homeostasis, and four PAH channelopathies (KCNK3, ABCC8, KCNA5, TRPC6) have been identified so far. However, the contribution of ion channels in other forms of PAH, which account for the majority of PAH patients, has been less well characterised. Here we reason that a variety of triggers of PAH (e.g. BMPR2 mutations, hypoxia, anorectic drugs) that impact channel function may contribute to the onset of the disease. We review the molecular mechanisms by which these 'extrinsic' factors converge on ion channels and provoke their dysregulation to promote the development of PAH. Ion channels of the pulmonary vasculature are therefore promising therapeutic targets because of the modulation they provide to both vasomotor tone and proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

1486,34166116,10.1152/japplphysiol.00205.2021,ATP and acetylcholine interact to modulate vascular tone and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic vasoconstriction in humans.,"The vascular endothelium senses and integrates numerous inputs to regulate vascular tone. Recent evidence reveals complex signal processing within the endothelium, yet little is known about how endothelium-dependent stimuli interact to regulate blood flow. We tested the hypothesis that combined stimulation of the endothelium with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetylcholine (ACh) elicits greater vasodilation and attenuates α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic vasoconstriction compared with combination of ATP or ACh with the endothelium-independent dilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP). We assessed forearm vascular conductance (FVC) in young adults (6 women, 7 men) during local intra-arterial infusion of ATP, ACh, or SNP alone and in the following combinations: ATP + ACh, SNP + ACh, and ATP + SNP, wherein the second dilator was coinfused after attaining steady state with the first dilator. By design, each dilator evoked a similar response when infused separately (ΔFVC, ATP: 48 ± 4; ACh: 57 ± 6; SNP: 53 ± 6 mL·min<sup>-1</sup>·100 mmHg<sup>-1</sup>; <i>P</i> ≥ 0.62). Combined infusion of the endothelium-dependent dilators evoked greater vasodilation than combination of either dilator with SNP (ΔFVC from first dilator, ATP + ACh: 45 ± 9 vs. SNP + ACh: 18 ± 7 and ATP + SNP: 26 ± 4 mL·min<sup>-1</sup>·100 mmHg<sup>-1</sup>, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Phenylephrine was subsequently infused to evaluate α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine elicited less vasoconstriction during infusion of ATP or ACh versus SNP (ΔFVC, -25 ± 3 and -29 ± 4 vs. -48 ± 3%; <i>P</i> < 0.05). The vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine was further diminished during combined infusion of ATP + ACh (-13 ± 3%; <i>P</i> < 0.05 vs. ATP or ACh alone) and was less than that observed when either dilator was combined with SNP (SNP + ACh: -26 ± 3%; ATP + SNP: -31 ± 4%; both <i>P</i> < 0.05 vs. ATP + ACh).

1498,none,none,none,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a serious neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The aim was to study complex cardiovascular autonomic regulation using heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) linear/non-linear analysis at rest and during orthostasis, and to assess plasma levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in autistic children. Twenty-five ASD boys and 25 age and gender-matched children at the age 7-15 years were examined. After venous blood taking, continuous ECG and blood pressure biosignals were recorded at rest and during orthostasis. Evaluated parameters: RR intervals, high- and low-frequency band of HRV spectral analysis (HF-HRV, LF-HRV), symbolic dynamics parameters 0V%, 1V%, 2LV%, 2UV%, low- and high-frequency band of SBPV (LF-SBPV, HF-SBPV), systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressure, EGF, VEGF plasma levels. RR intervals were significantly shortened and the HF-HRV, LF-SBPV, HF-SBPV parameters were significantly lower at rest, the HF-HRV and LF-SBPV remained lower during orthostasis in autistic children compared to controls (p<0.05). EGF plasma levels were significantly lower in ASD compared to controls (p=0.046). No significant differences were found in remaining parameters. Our study revealed tachycardia, cardiovagal underactivity, and blunted sympathetic vasomotor regulation at rest and during orthostasis in autistic children. Additionally, complex heart rate dynamics are similar in autistic children than controls. Furthermore, EGF was reduced in autistic children without significant correlations with any autonomic parameters. We suggest that the abnormal complex cardiovascular reflex control could contribute to understanding the pathway linking autonomic features and autism.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Herein, we assessed the interplay between MB and coronary vasomotor disorders, also evaluating their prognostic relevance in patients with myocardial infarction and non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) or stable NOCAD. Methods and Results We prospectively enrolled patients with NOCAD undergoing intracoronary acetylcholine provocative test. The incidence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for unstable angina, was assessed at follow-up. We also assessed angina status using Seattle Angina Questionnaires summary score. We enrolled 310 patients (mean age, 60.6±11.9; 136 [43.9%] men; 169 [54.5%] stable NOCAD and 141 [45.5%] MINOCA). MB was found in 53 (17.1%) patients. MB and a positive acetylcholine test coexisted more frequently in patients with MINOCA versus stable NOCAD. MB was an independent predictor of positive acetylcholine test and MINOCA. At follow-up (median, 22 months; interquartile range, 13-32), patients with MB had a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events, mainly driven by a higher rate of hospitalization attributable to angina, and a lower Seattle Angina Questionnaires summary score (all <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients without MB. In particular, the group of patients with MB and a positive acetylcholine test had the worst prognosis.

It is challenging for patients and physicians because it leads to significant morbidity due to chronic pain that may last for years. CRPS typically develops four to six weeks after direct trauma, such as an injury or surgery, and causes pain that is out of proportion to the inciting injury. It is associated with multiple physiologic mechanisms, affecting skin texture or localized sensory, motor, sudomotor, and vasomotor pathways. The diagnosis is made clinically using standardized diagnostic criteria. Ancillary testing is not necessary for the diagnosis of CRPS but can be useful to rule out alternative diagnoses. There are two types of CRPS, type 1 and type 2, although treatment is the same for both. There is no single proven treatment modality for CRPS, and there have been no large randomized controlled studies of CRPS treatments. Most treatments are based on studies of their use for other types of neuropathic pain. The mainstay of treatment is to improve function of the affected body part and to decrease pain; therefore, treatment requires multiple modalities, including medications, behavioral health interventions, and referral to a pain specialist.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Extreme mouth-opening limitation is one of the symptoms in the oral cavity, and compromises dental intervention. One of the fundamental steps when performing a dental procedure is dental arch impression. In the presented clinical case, limited mouth opening hindered the impression accuracy. The objective was to present an alternative impression technique for a patient affected by scleroderma, with limited mouth opening and the need for oral rehabilitation with a removable partial prosthesis in the maxillary arch. An individualized tray was developed with design characteristics that allowed access to the oral cavity and removal, after which it was possible to perform the oral impression, reproducing the areas of interest without causing injury to the oral tissues. The orientation plan was elaborated after obtaining the cast. The teeth were assembled, tested in the mouth, and sent to the laboratory for acrylization. The prosthesis was placed once ready. The alternative impression technique enabled oral rehabilitation of the patient despite the mouth-opening limitation, and provided an accurate impression and a good prosthetic result.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

Hence, this study sought to investigate the impact of estrogen deficiency during catecholamine stress on vasomotor function. Also, attempts were made to utilize estrogen replacement therapy to mitigate the adverse effects (pathological remodeling) of stress on the aortic vessels to preserve vasomotor functions. To do this, female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were ovariectomized (OVX) along with sham operations (Sham). Day 14 after OVX operation, 17-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) was subcutaneously implanted (OVX+E<sub>2</sub>). Day 35 after operation, stress was induced by isoproterenol (ISO) subcutaneous injections. Clinically relevant blood pressure indexes (systolic, diastolic, and mean atrial blood pressures) were assessed in the rats. Aortic vascular ring tensions were assessed <i>in vitro</i> to ascertain the impact of E<sub>2</sub> on their vasomotor function.

1793,none,none,none,"In spite of the fact that the modulatory effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the sympathetic nerve activity to targeted organs involved in blood pressure (BP) regulation is well acknowledged, the local production of this peptide in the brain and the consequences of enhanced central Ang II beyond the cardiovascular system are not yet well comprehended. In the present study, we generated and validated a new transgenic mouse line overexpressing the rat full-length angiotensinogen (Agt) protein specifically in the brain (Agt-Tg). Adult Agt-Tg mice presented overall increased gene expression of total Agt in the brain including brainstem and hypothalamus. In addition, the excess of Agt led to abundantly detectable brain Ang II levels as well as increased circulating copeptin levels. Agt-Tg displayed raised BP in acute recordings, while long-term telemetrically measured basal BP was indistinguishable from wild-types. Agt-Tg has altered peripheral renin-angiotensin system and vasomotor sympathetic tone homeostasis because renal gene expression analysis, plasma Ang II measurements and ganglionic blockade experiments revealed suppressed renin expression and reduced Ang II and higher neurogenic pressure response, respectively. Plasma and urine screens revealed apparently normal fluid and electrolyte handling in Agt-Tg. Interestingly, hematological analyses showed increased hematocrit in Agt-Tg caused by enhanced erythropoiesis, which was reverted by submitting the transgenic mice to a long-term peripheral sympathectomy protocol. Collectively, our findings suggest that Agt-Tg is a valuable tool to study not only brain Ang II formation and its modulatory effects on cardiovascular homeostasis but also its role in erythropoiesis control via autonomic modulation.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

The Effects of Retrograde Flow on Isolated Perfused Lungs and Vessels.,"Retrograde perfusion may occur during disease, surgery or extracorporeal circulation. While it is clear that endothelial cells sense and respond to changes in blood flow, the consequences of retrograde perfusion are only poorly defined. Similar to shear stress or disturbed flow, retrograde perfusion might result in vasomotor responses, edema formation or inflammation in and around vessels. In this study we investigated in rats the effects of retrograde perfusion in isolated systemic vessels (IPV) and in pulmonary vessels of isolated perfused lungs (IPL). Anterograde and retrograde perfusion was performed for 480 min in IPV and for 180 min in the IPL. Perfusion pressure, cytokine levels in perfusate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), edema formation and mRNA expression were studied. In IPV, an increased perfusion pressure and initially also increased cytokine levels were observed during retrograde perfusion. In the IPL, increased edema formation occurred, while cytokine levels were not increased, though dilution of cytokines in BALF due to pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. In conclusion, effects of flow reversal were visible immediately after initiation of retrograde perfusion. Pulmonary edema formation was the only effect of the 3 h retrograde perfusion.

The Effects of Retrograde Flow on Isolated Perfused Lungs and Vessels.,"Retrograde perfusion may occur during disease, surgery or extracorporeal circulation. While it is clear that endothelial cells sense and respond to changes in blood flow, the consequences of retrograde perfusion are only poorly defined. Similar to shear stress or disturbed flow, retrograde perfusion might result in vasomotor responses, edema formation or inflammation in and around vessels. In this study we investigated in rats the effects of retrograde perfusion in isolated systemic vessels (IPV) and in pulmonary vessels of isolated perfused lungs (IPL). Anterograde and retrograde perfusion was performed for 480 min in IPV and for 180 min in the IPL. Perfusion pressure, cytokine levels in perfusate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), edema formation and mRNA expression were studied. In IPV, an increased perfusion pressure and initially also increased cytokine levels were observed during retrograde perfusion. In the IPL, increased edema formation occurred, while cytokine levels were not increased, though dilution of cytokines in BALF due to pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. In conclusion, effects of flow reversal were visible immediately after initiation of retrograde perfusion. Pulmonary edema formation was the only effect of the 3 h retrograde perfusion.

The post-competition vasodilation and sympathetic vasomotor tone predict the marathon performance in younger men, but their prognostic relevance in older men remains unknown. The peripheral chemoreflex restrains exercise-induced vasodilation via sympathetically-mediated mechanism, what makes it a plausible candidate for the individual performance marker. 23 men aged ≥ 50 year competing in the Wroclaw Marathon underwent an evaluation of: resting haemodynamic parameters, PCheS with two methods: transient hypoxia and breath-holding test (BHT), cardiac barosensitivity, heart rate variability (HRV) and BPV, plasma renin and aldosterone, VO<sub>2max</sub> in a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). All tests were conducted twice: before and after the race, except for transient hypoxia and CPET which were performed once, before the race. Fast marathon performance and high VO<sub>2max</sub> were correlated with: low ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (r =  - 0.53, r = 0.67, respectively) and pre-race BHT (r =  - 0.47, r = 0.51, respectively), (1) greater SD of beat-to-beat SBP (all p < 0.05). Fast performance was related with an enhanced pre-race vascular response to BHT (r =  - 0.59, p = 0.005).

Fast marathon performance and high VO<sub>2max</sub> were correlated with: low ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (r =  - 0.53, r = 0.67, respectively) and pre-race BHT (r =  - 0.47, r = 0.51, respectively), (1) greater SD of beat-to-beat SBP (all p < 0.05). Fast performance was related with an enhanced pre-race vascular response to BHT (r =  - 0.59, p = 0.005). The variables found by other studies to predict the marathon performance in younger men: post-competition vasodilation, sympathetic vasomotor tone (LF-BPV) and HRV were not associated with the individual performance in our population. The results suggest that PCheS (ventilatory response) predicts individual performance (marathon time and VO<sub>2max</sub>) in men aged ≥ 50 yeat. Although cause-effect relationship including the role of peripheral chemoreceptors in restraining the post-competition vasodilation via the sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow may be hypothesized to underline these findings, the lack of correlation between individual performance and both, the post-competition vasodilation and the sympathetic vasomotor tone argues against such explanation.

Because perivascular sensory nerves and their transmitters calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) are important mediators of both vasodilation and inflammatory responses, our objective was to identify IBD-related deficits in perivascular sensory nerve function and vascular neurotransmitter signaling. In MAs from an interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse model, IBD significantly impairs electrical field stimulation (EFS)-mediated sensory vasodilation and inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction, despite decreased sympathetic nerve density and vasoconstriction. The MA content and EFS-mediated release of both CGRP and SP are decreased with IBD, but IBD has unique effects on each transmitter. CGRP nerve density, receptor expression, hyperpolarization, and vasodilation are preserved with IBD. In contrast, SP nerve density and receptor expression are increased, and SP hyperpolarization and vasodilation are impaired with IBD. A key finding is that blockade of SP receptors restores EFS-mediated sensory vasodilation and enhanced CGRP-mediated vasodilation in MAs from IBD but not Control mice. Together, these data suggest that an aberrant role for the perivascular sensory neurotransmitter SP and its downstream signaling in MAs underlies vascular dysfunction with IBD. We propose that with IBD, SP signaling impedes CGRP-mediated sensory vasodilation, contributing to impaired blood flow. Thus, substance P and NK1 receptors may represent an important target for treating vascular dysfunction in IBD.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Our study is the first to show that IBD causes profound impairment of sensory vasodilation and inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries.

1987,33645659,10.1111/psyp.13800,"The cardiac, vasomotor, and myocardial branches of the baroreflex in fibromyalgia: Associations with pain, affective impairments, sleep problems, and fatigue.","This study investigated the cardiac, vasomotor, and myocardial branches of the baroreflex in fibromyalgia using the spontaneous sequence method. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), interbeat interval (IBI), stroke volume (SV), pre-ejection period (PEP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were continuously recorded in 40 fibromyalgia patients and 30 healthy individuals during a cold pressor test and a mental arithmetic task. Sequences of covariation between SBP and IBI (cardiac branch), SV and PEP (myocardial branch), and TPR (vasomotor branch) were identified.

2005,34124295,10.21769/BioProtoc.3994,Development of a Chemical Reproductive Aging Model in Female Rats.,"Women are born with an abundant but finite pool of ovarian follicles, which naturally and progressively decreased during their reproductive years until menstrual periods stop permanently (menopause). Perimenopause represents the transition from reproductive to non-reproductive life. It is usually characterized by neuroendocrine, metabolic and behavioral changes, which result from a follicular depletion and reduced number of ovarian follicles. During this period, around 45-50 years old, women are more likely to express mood disorders, anxiety, irritability and vasomotor symptoms. The current animal models of reproductive aging do not successfully replicate human perimenopause and the gradual changes that occur in this phase. While the traditional rat model of menopause involves ovariectomy or surgical menopause consisting of the rapid and definitive removal of the ovaries resulting in a complete loss of all ovarian hormones, natural or transitional menopause is achieved by the selective loss of ovarian follicles (perimenopause period). However, the natural aging rodent (around 18-24 months) model fails to reach very low estrogen concentrations and overlaps the processes of somatic and reproductive aging. The chronic exposure of young rodents to 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) is a well-established experimental model for perimenopause and menopause studies. VCD induces loss of ovarian small follicles (primary and primordial) in mice and rats by accelerating the natural process of atresia (apoptosis). The VCD, ovary-intact or accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) model is the experimental model that most closely matches natural human progression to menopause mimicking both hormonal and behavioral changes typically manifested by women in perimenopause.

However, many women do not manage this symptom properly due to insufficient knowledge of the symptoms or sexual embarrassment.

Topical lubricants and moisturizers, systemic and local estrogens, testosterones, intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterones (DHEAs), selective estrogen receptor modulators, and energy-based therapies are possible treatment modalities. Systemic and local estrogen therapies effectively treat genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), but they are contraindicated in patients with breast cancer, for whom lubricants and moisturizers must be considered as the primary treatment. Intravaginal DHEA and ospemifene can be recommended for moderate to severe GSM; however, there is insufficient data on the use of intravaginal DHEA or ospemifene in patients with breast cancer, and further studies are needed. Energy-based devices such as vaginal laser therapy reportedly alleviate GSM symptoms; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning has recently been issued because of complications such as chronic pain and burning sensations of the vagina.

2043,none,none,none,"Sex matters in science. This particularly applies to ischemic heart disease, which displays key differences in pathophysiology, presentation, and effectiveness in diagnostic strategies and management between women and men. However, underrepresentation of women in randomized trials has led to an evidence gap in clinical practice. Nevertheless, it has become clear that women present with a higher burden of symptoms and comorbidities, experience worse outcomes, but are less likely to have flow-limiting stenosis in epicardial coronary arteries than men. A major contributor to this paradox is coronary microvascular disease, a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial etiology that predominantly affects women. There is a significant interplay between coronary microvascular disease, obstructive coronary artery disease, and the cardiovascular risk associated with it, with impaired vasomotor function often preceding the development of advanced atheroma. This novel concept has recently been referred to as chronic coronary syndromes, which better meets the female phenotype of ischemic heart disease, questioning current management recommendations that still largely apply to flow-limiting stenoses in epicardial coronary arteries typically found in men. The goal of this review is to highlight the most recent scientific advances in understanding chronic coronary syndromes in women. It provides practical advice with focus on challenges in diagnosis and management, and discusses perspectives towards the implementation of sex-specific, safer, and more effective therapeutic strategies.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

This study examined whether persistent endothelial vasomotor dysfunction is related to MACE occurrence in the infarct-related coronary artery (IRA) of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) survivors using serial assessments of the coronary vasomotor response to acetylcholine (ACh). This study included 169 consecutive patients with a first acute STEMI due to left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion and successful reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention. Vasomotor response to ACh in the LAD was measured within 2 weeks of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (first test) and repeated 6 months (second test) after AMI under optimal anti-atherosclerotic therapy. MACE was defined as the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal MI, angina recurrence requiring percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass, and hospitalization for heart failure. We followed up 126 patients for a period of ≤ 60 months until MACE occurrence after second test. Nineteen MACEs occurred during the follow-up. The log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that MACE occurrence was significantly associated with the persistent impairment of epicardial coronary artery dilation and coronary blood flow increases in response to ACh (log-rank test, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Hazard ratio, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).

MACE was defined as the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal MI, angina recurrence requiring percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass, and hospitalization for heart failure. We followed up 126 patients for a period of ≤ 60 months until MACE occurrence after second test. Nineteen MACEs occurred during the follow-up. The log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that MACE occurrence was significantly associated with the persistent impairment of epicardial coronary artery dilation and coronary blood flow increases in response to ACh (log-rank test, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Hazard ratio, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Persistent impairment of endothelial vasomotor function in the infarct-related conduit arterial segment and resistance arteriole were the significant predictor of future MACE occurrence in STEMI survivors.",2020,11,16,Heart Vessels,Heart and vessels,Cardiovascular event; Coronary endothelial function; Myocardial infarction,Saito,Yukio,"Department of Internal Medicine II, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, 1110 Shimokato, Chuo, Yamanashi, 409-3898, Japan",none

Eight weeks of fructose administration did not affect SBP, glycaemia, or the plasma levels of total cholesterol or low-density and high-density lipoprotein; however, it significantly increased the plasma levels of γ-glutamyl transferase and alanine transaminase. Chronic fructose intake deteriorated endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (EDVR) and increased the sensitivity of adrenergic receptors to noradrenaline. Acute NOS inhibition evoked a reduction in EDVR that was similar between groups; however, it increased adrenergic contraction more in fructose-fed rats. CSE inhibition decreased EDVR in WKY but not in fructose-fed rats. The application of a H<sub>2</sub>S scavenger evoked a reduction in the EDVR in WKY rats and normalized the sensitivity of adrenergic receptors in rats treated with fructose.

2132,33792905,10.1002/cphy.c200024,Vasculopathy in Sickle Cell Disease: From Red Blood Cell Sickling to Vascular Dysfunction.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder that leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS). HbS polymerizes in deoxygenated conditions, which can prompt red blood cell (RBC) sickling and leaves the RBCs more rigid, fragile, and prone to hemolysis. SCD patients suffer from a plethora of complications, ranging from acute complications, such as characteristic, frequent, and debilitating vaso-occlusive episodes to chronic organ damage. While RBC sickling is the primary event at the origin of vaso-occlusive processes, other factors that can further increase RBC transit times in the microcirculation may also be required to precipitate vaso-occlusive processes. The adhesion of RBC and leukocytes to activated endothelium and the formation of heterocellular aggregates, as well as increased blood viscosity, are among the mechanisms involved in slowing the progress of RBCs in deoxygenated vascular areas, favoring RBC sickling and promoting vascular occlusion. Chronic inflammatory processes and oxidative stress, which are perpetuated by hemolytic events and ischemia-reperfusion injury, result in this pan cellular activation and some acute events, such as stroke and acute chest syndrome, as well as chronic end-organ damage. Furthermore, impaired vasodilation and vasomotor hyperresponsiveness in SCD also contribute to vaso-occlusive processes. Treating SCD as a vascular disease in addition to its hematological perspective, the present article looks at the interplay between abnormal RBC physiology/integrity, vascular dysfunction and clinical severity in SCD, and discusses existing therapies and novel drugs in development that may ameliorate vascular complications in the disease. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

The SOFT trial demonstrated small but statistically significant incremental improvements in long-term disease-free survival by the addition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog treatment (triptorelin) to an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane). Profound hypoestrogenism in the premenopausal age group may not be well tolerated due to a host of bothersome side effects (primarily vasomotor symptoms, musculoskeletal complaints, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and mood disorders). Prolonged hypoestrogenism in younger women is associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease, bone loss, cognitive decline, and all-cause mortality. This paper explores multi-system consequences of prolonged hypoestrogenism in premenopausal women derived from studies of women with and without breast cancer. Pretreatment counseling in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer should emphasize the benefit of prolonged estrogen suppression on breast cancer recurrence and established risks of lifelong hypoestrogenism on quality of life and all-cause mortality.

Transcranial Doppler was used to assess pre- to post-season changes in: (1) resting middle (MCA) and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA), (2) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) via breath-holding index (BHI), vasomotor reactivity response (VMRr) and overall MCA response curve, and (3) neurovascular coupling (NVC) via NVC response magnitude and overall PCA response curve. Fifty-three high school-aged athletes (age = 15.8 ± 1.2years, height = 175.8 ± 8.1cm, mass = 69.4 ± 13.5kg) were recruited into two groups (collision vs. non-collision sport). All participants completed a pre-season cerebrovascular function assessment. Following a 4- to 5-month window (118.6 ± 12.2 days), 48 athletes from the original sample (age = 16.0 ± 1.2 years, height = 175.5 ± 8.1 cm, mass = 68.6 ± 4.0 kg) repeated the cerebrovascular assessment.

Independent clinical predictors of OSA included male gender (OR 2.22, 1.86-2.65, P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.84, 1.58-2.14, P < 0.001), depression (OR 1.81, 1.55-2.12, P < 0.001), prior heart failure (OR 1.63, 1.22-2.18, P = 0.001), hypertension (OR 1.61, 1.32-1.95, P ≤ 0.001), asthma (OR 1.61, 1.34-1.93, P < 0.001), not a current smoker (OR 1.60, 1.30-1.96, P < 0.001), dyslipidaemia (OR 1.46, 1.22-1.76, P < 0.001), non-acute coronary syndrome presentation (OR 1.45, 1.25-1.69, P < 0.001), chronic lung disease (OR 1.40, 1.12-1.73, P = 0.003), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.36, 1.07-1.73, P = 0.012), non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) (OR 1.30, 1.10-1.55, P = 0.003) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (OR 1.30, 1.06-1.60, P = 0.012). Finally, stable angina (32.1% vs 22.7%) and NOCAD (29.1% vs 26.3%, P = 0.051) were trended more common in patients with OSA versus no OSA. In addition to established risk factors for OSA, this study found NOCAD to be independent predictor of OSA; especially in those presenting with a stable angina presentation. This suggests that coronary vasomotor disorders may be associated with OSA, although further detailed studies are required.",2021,03,20,Curr Probl Cardiol,Current problems in cardiology,none,Beltrame,John,"Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Department of Cardiology, Northern Adelaide Local Health Network, Adelaide, Australia",john.beltrame@adelaide.edu.au.
2187,33809928,3212,Utilization of Isoflavones in Soybeans for Women with Menopausal Syndrome: An Overview.,"Based on their nutrient composition, soybeans and related foods have been considered to be nutritious and healthy for humans. Particularly, the biological activity and subsequent benefits of soy products may be associated with the presence of isoflavone in soybeans. As an alternative treatment for menopause-related symptoms, isoflavone has gained much popularity for postmenopausal women who have concerns related to undergoing hormone replacement therapy. However, current research has still not reached a consensus on the effects of isoflavone on humans. This overview is a summary of the current literature about the processing of soybeans and isoflavone types (daidzein, genistein, and S-equol) and supplements and their extraction and analysis as well as information about the utilization of isoflavones in soybeans. The processes of preparation (cleaning, drying, crushing and dehulling) and extraction of soybeans are implemented to produce refined soy oil, soy lecithin, free fatty acids, glycerol and soybean meal. The remaining components consist of inorganic constituents (minerals) and the minor components of biologically interesting small molecules. Regarding the preventive effects on diseases or cancers, a higher intake of isoflavones is associated with a moderately lower risk of developing coronary heart disease. It may also reduce the risks of breast and colorectal cancer as well as the incidence of breast cancer recurrence. Consumption of isoflavones or soy foods is associated with reduced risks of endometrial and bladder cancer. Regarding the therapeutic effects on menopausal syndrome or other diseases, isoflavones have been found to alleviate vasomotor syndromes even after considering placebo effects, reduce bone loss in the spine and ameliorate hypertension and in vitro glycemic control. They may also alleviate depressive symptoms during pregnancy. On the other hand, isoflavones have not shown definitive effects regarding improving cognition and urogenital symptoms. Because of lacking standardization in the study designs, such as the ingredients and doses of isoflavones and the durations and outcomes of trials, it currently remains difficult to draw overall conclusions for all aspects of isoflavones. These limitations warrant further investigations of isoflavone use for women's health.",2021,03,22,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,isoflavones; menopause; soybeans,Chen,Li-Ru,"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei 10049, Taiwan",none

We hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vascular dysfunction is present in a murine model of preeclampsia based on administration of human preeclamptic sera to interleukin-10-/- mice and studied mechanisms that underlie vascular injury. Pregnant wild type and IL-10-/- mice were injected with either normotensive or severe preeclamptic patient sera (sPE) during gestation. A preeclampsia-like phenotype was confirmed by blood pressure measurements; assessment of albuminuria; measurement of angiogenic factors; demonstration of foot process effacement and endotheliosis in kidney sections; and by accumulation of glycogen in placentas from IL-10-/- mice injected with sPE sera (IL-10-/-sPE). Vasomotor function of isolated aortas was assessed. The IL-10-/-sPE murine model demonstrated significantly augmented aortic contractions to phenylephrine and both impaired endothelium-dependent and, to a lesser extent, endothelium-independent relaxation compared to wild type normotensive mice. Treatment of isolated aortas with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, improved, but failed to normalize contraction to phenylephrine to that of wild type normotensive mice, suggesting the additional contribution from nitric oxide downregulation and effects of indomethacin-resistant vasoconstricting factors. In contrast, indomethacin normalized relaxation of aortas derived from IL-10-/-sPE mice. Thus, our results identify the role of IL-10 deficiency in dysregulation of the cyclooxygenase pathway and vascular dysfunction in the IL-10-/-sPE murine model of preeclampsia and point towards a possible contribution of nitric oxide dysregulation.

Treatment of isolated aortas with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, improved, but failed to normalize contraction to phenylephrine to that of wild type normotensive mice, suggesting the additional contribution from nitric oxide downregulation and effects of indomethacin-resistant vasoconstricting factors. In contrast, indomethacin normalized relaxation of aortas derived from IL-10-/-sPE mice. Thus, our results identify the role of IL-10 deficiency in dysregulation of the cyclooxygenase pathway and vascular dysfunction in the IL-10-/-sPE murine model of preeclampsia and point towards a possible contribution of nitric oxide dysregulation.

The aim of this study was to compare contemporary German and Japanese patients with coronary spasm. Between 2011 and 2015, 149 patients with resting angina and unobstructed coronary arteries with acetylcholine-induced epicardial spasm were enrolled in Stuttgart, Germany (n = 69) and Sendai, Japan (n = 80). All patients underwent intracoronary acetylcholine testing according to a standardized protocol. Comprehensive analysis included type of spasm (focal/diffuse), dose of acetylcholine leading to spasm, and frequency of multivessel spasm. Patients in this study were 61 ± 11 years old, predominantly female (54%), and had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (73 ± 9%). Diffuse spasm was the most prevalent type of spasm (85%) whereas focal spasm was found in the remaining 15% of patients. 31% of patients had multivessel spasm. Comparing the German with the Japanese patients, distribution of spasm type (focal/diffuse, p = 0.19) and frequency of multivessel spasm (p = 0.22) were comparable. Moreover, when Japanese patients were compared with German patients and diffuse spasm with focal spasm patients, respectively, no significant differences were observed regarding the acetylcholine dose required to induce spasm (p = 0.078 and p = 0.46, respectively).

The risk of POI before the age of 40 is 1%. Clinical symptoms develop as a result of estrogen deficiency and may include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, vasomotor instability (hot flushes, night sweats), sleep disturbances, vulvovaginal atrophy, altered urinary frequency, dyspareunia, low libido, and lack of energy. Most causes of POI remain undefined, however, it is estimated that anywhere from 4-30% of cases are autoimmune in origin. As the ovaries are a common target for autoimmune attacks, an autoimmune etiology of POI should always be considered, especially in the presence of anti-oocyte antibodies (AOAs), autoimmune diseases, or lymphocytic oophoritis in biopsy. POI can occur in isolation, but is often associated with other autoimmune conditions. Concordant thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Grave's disease are most commonly seen. Adrenal autoimmune disorders are the second most common disorders associated with POI. Among women with diabetes mellitus, POI develops in roughly 2.5%. Additionally, autoimmune-related POI can also present as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS), a condition in which autoimmune activity causes specific endocrine organ damage.

Clinical symptoms develop as a result of estrogen deficiency and may include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, vasomotor instability (hot flushes, night sweats), sleep disturbances, vulvovaginal atrophy, altered urinary frequency, dyspareunia, low libido, and lack of energy. Most causes of POI remain undefined, however, it is estimated that anywhere from 4-30% of cases are autoimmune in origin. As the ovaries are a common target for autoimmune attacks, an autoimmune etiology of POI should always be considered, especially in the presence of anti-oocyte antibodies (AOAs), autoimmune diseases, or lymphocytic oophoritis in biopsy. POI can occur in isolation, but is often associated with other autoimmune conditions. Concordant thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Grave's disease are most commonly seen. Adrenal autoimmune disorders are the second most common disorders associated with POI. Among women with diabetes mellitus, POI develops in roughly 2.5%. Additionally, autoimmune-related POI can also present as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS), a condition in which autoimmune activity causes specific endocrine organ damage. In its most common presentation (type-3), APS is associated with Hashomoto's type thyroid antibodies and has a prevalence of 10-40%. 21OH-Antibodies in Addison's disease (AD) can develop in association to APS-2.",2021,03,05,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,APS; Hashimoto disease; POI; autoimmune,Meczekalski,Blazej,"Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-535 Poznan, Poland",none
2302,33799860,418,Pharmacological and Genetic Evidence of Dopamine Receptor 3-Mediated Vasoconstriction in Isolated Mouse Aorta.,"Dopamine receptors (DRs) are generally considered as mediators of vasomotor functions. However, when used in pharmacological studies, dopamine and/or DR agonists may not discriminate among different DR subtypes and may even stimulate alpha1 and beta-adrenoceptors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that D2R and/or D3R may specifically induce vasoconstriction in isolated mouse aorta. Aorta, isolated from wild-type (WT) and D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> mice, was mounted in a wire myograph and challenged with cumulative concentrations of phenylephrine (PE), acetylcholine (ACh), and the D3R agonist 7-hydrxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT), with or without the D2R antagonist L741,626 and the D3R antagonist SB-277011-A. The vasoconstriction to PE and the vasodilatation to ACh were not different in WT and D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>; in contrast, the contractile responses to 7-OH-DPAT were significantly weaker in D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>, though not abolished. L741,626 did not change the contractile response induced by 7-OH-DPAT in WT or in D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>, whereas SB-277011-A significantly reduced it in WT but did not in D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>. D3R mRNA (assessed by qPCR) was about 5-fold more abundant than D2R mRNA in aorta from WT and undetectable in aorta from D3R<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>. Following transduction with lentivirus (72-h incubation) delivering synthetic microRNAs to specifically inactivate D2R (LV-miR-D2) or D3R (LV-miR-D3), the contractile response to 7-OH-DPAT was unaffected by LV-miR-D2, while it was significantly reduced by LV-miR-D3. These data indicate that, at least in mouse aorta, D3R stimulation induces vasoconstriction, while D2R stimulation does not. This is consistent with the higher expression level of D3R.

However, harmful adverse events (AEs) and significant differences in drug response among individuals remain a significant problem in clinical application. Current evidence suggests that the observed individual variation in the treatment outcomes of AI is conferred by genetic variants. Hence, in this study, we examined the association of TCL1A gene polymorphisms with letrozole-induced AEs. The study subjects were postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole. Genomic DNA was isolated by a routine standard phenol-chloroform method. In total, 198 South Indian patients were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCL1A gene loci by the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay using the RT-PCR system. We used the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval to assess the genetic association. Musculoskeletal (MS) AEs and vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) are the most common side effects observed in the study cohort. Among 198 patients, 81 experienced musculoskeletal toxicity, reporting MS-AEs, 57 had VMSs, and 33 of them had both. The most frequently identified polymorphic variants in the patient series were rs11849538 (G), with an allele frequency of about 27.3%, followed by rs7158782-G (27.3%), rs7159713-G (25.8%), and rs2369049-G (22.5%). The genetic association analysis indicated no significant difference in the proportion of TCL1A gene variants between patients with and without AEs on either MS-AEs or VMSs.

However, harmful adverse events (AEs) and significant differences in drug response among individuals remain a significant problem in clinical application. Current evidence suggests that the observed individual variation in the treatment outcomes of AI is conferred by genetic variants. Hence, in this study, we examined the association of TCL1A gene polymorphisms with letrozole-induced AEs. The study subjects were postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole. Genomic DNA was isolated by a routine standard phenol-chloroform method. In total, 198 South Indian patients were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCL1A gene loci by the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay using the RT-PCR system. We used the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval to assess the genetic association. Musculoskeletal (MS) AEs and vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) are the most common side effects observed in the study cohort. Among 198 patients, 81 experienced musculoskeletal toxicity, reporting MS-AEs, 57 had VMSs, and 33 of them had both. The most frequently identified polymorphic variants in the patient series were rs11849538 (G), with an allele frequency of about 27.3%, followed by rs7158782-G (27.3%), rs7159713-G (25.8%), and rs2369049-G (22.5%).

Finally, data on long-term efficacy and tolerability are still incomplete, especially for drugs more recently introduced in the market.",2021,02,18,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,Emerging drugs; mechanism-based treatment; new treatments; pharmacotherapy; rosacea; topical treatment,Micali,Giuseppe,"Dermatology Clinic, University of Catania, Catania, Italy",none

Forearm blood flow was determined (via plethysmography) in response to intra-arterial acetylcholine (ACh), BQ-123 (ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist), ACh + BQ-123, and sodium nitroprusside. Forearm blood flow responses to ACh were lower (∼20%; <i>P</i> < 0.05) in the short (from 4.2 ± 0.2 to 10.5 ± 0.6 mL/100 mL tissue/min) versus normal (4.2 ± 0.2 to 12.7 ± 0.6 mL/100 mL tissue/min) sleepers. In response to BQ-123, the short-sleep group had a significantly greater increase in resting forearm blood flow than the normal-sleep group (∼25% vs. ∼8%). ACh + BQ-123 resulted in a significant (∼25%) increase in the ACh-mediated vasodilation in the short-sleep group only.

We recorded diametric changes using videomicroscopic techniques. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In a dose-dependent (10 nM-30 μM) manner, retinal arterioles were relaxed in response to ripasudil [maximum % resting diameter, 160.3% ± 7.7% (mean ± standard error of the mean)].

In addition, different tests have been carried out on the possibility of colonization of mattresses by fungi, bacteria and arthropod pests, and rheological, chemical and flammability tests. The research material in the form of buckwheat husks was tested in a diverse way. All tests indicate high usefulness of husks for therapeutic activity. This material was contaminated with fungi, bacteria and pests at a very low level, related to the natural colonization of buckwheat nuts during harvest and storage. The quality of the husks was also confirmed in rheological, chemical and flammability studies. Finally, this has also been confirmed in surveys conducted on people with health problems.

Coronary vasomotor disorders (impaired vasodilatation and/or enhanced vasoconstriction/spasm) represent important functional causes for such a clinical presentation. Although impaired vasodilatation may be assessed with non-invasive techniques such as positron emission tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, there is currently no reliable non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of coronary spasm available.

2399,33529222,10.1371/journal.pone.0246254,Vasomotor action of androgens in the mesenteric artery of hypertensive rats. Role of perivascular innervation.,"Androgens may exert cardiovascular protective actions by regulating the release and function of different vascular factors. In addition, testosterone (TES) and its 5-reduced metabolites, 5α- and 5β-dihydrotestosterone (5α- and 5β-DHT) induce vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects. Furthermore, hypertension has been reported to alter the release and function of the neurotransmitters nitric oxide (NO), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and noradrenaline (NA). Since the mesenteric arteries possess a dense perivascular innervation and significantly regulate total peripheral vascular resistance, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of TES, 5α- and 5β-DHT on the neurogenic release and vasomotor function of NO, CGRP and NA. For this purpose, the superior mesenteric artery from male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats was used to analyze: (i) the effect of androgens (10 nM, incubated for 30 min) on the neurogenic release of NO, CGRP and NA and (ii) the vasoconstrictor-response to NA and the vasodilator responses to the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and exogenous CGRP. The results showed that TES, 5α- or 5β-DHT did not modify the release of NO, CGRP or NA induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in the arteries of SHR; however, in the arteries of WKY rats androgens only caused an increase in EFS-induced NO release. Moreover, TES, and especially 5β-DHT, increased the vasodilator response induced by SNP and CGRP in the arteries of SHR. These findings could be contributing to the hypotensive/antihypertensive efficacy of 5β-DHT previously described in conscious SHR and WKY rats, pointing to 5β- DHT as a potential drug for the treatment of hypertension.",2021,02,02,PLoS One,PloS one,none,Isidoro-García,Lucía,"Departamento de Fisiología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain",none

They have both genomic and non-genomic effects, displaying weak affinity for estrogen receptors (ER) and preferentially binding to ER-B over ER-A. However, evidence for the benefits of phytoestrogen consumption has been limited. We conducted a review of recent literature, focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting on postreproductive health effects of phytoestrogens. While many trials concerning dietary and supplementary phytoestrogens have been conducted, evidence of clinical efficacy is heterogeneous and inconclusive. There appears to be reduction in the vasomotor symptoms of menopause with phytoestrogen intake; however, it is likely small and slow in onset. Phytoestrogens also appear to improve bone mineral density and markers of cardiovascular risk; however, there is inadequate research regarding long-term outcomes. There appear to be no harmful effects of phytoestrogens on breast, endometrial cancer or colorectal cancer and phytoestrogens intake may in fact be protective.

Although the interrelation between cortisol and cytokines was fully elucidated previously, few studies considered how their association with exercise can affect brain structures or play an anti-inflammatory role in preserving cognitive function among older adults. To evaluate both the neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory activities of moderate aerobic exercise in improving cognitive performance among healthy older adults, the serum levels of CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and cortisol and their correlation with cognitive performance were estimated in all participants. A total of 60 healthy older adults aged 50-85 years were included in this study. The Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) test, colorimetric testing, and ELISA immunoassays were used to measure cognitive abilities; blood sugar; and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cortisol, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, respectively, in older adults before and after 12-week exercise interventions. Exactly 50% of the participants showed moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) (LOTCA scores: 84.8 ± 8.2), and the remaining 50% of the participants (n = 30) were diagnosed as normal healthy subjects (LOTCA scores: 98.7 ± 8.1). There was a significant association between cognitive decline in LOTCA scores of motor praxis, vasomotor organization, thinking operations, and attention and concentration and higher levels of cortisol, CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as adiposity markers BMI and WHR, in the MCI group compared to control subjects. However, significant improvements in the same LOTCA score domains in MCI subjects were recorded along with decrements in the levels of cortisol and cytokine CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as improved adiposity markers, following a 12-week moderate exercise program. Cognitive performance correlated positively with cortisol levels and negatively with physical activity, adiposity markers, and cytokine levels. Also, in participants with normal and abnormal cortisol profiles, there was a positive interrelation between cytokine levels and cortisol. Moderate aerobic exercise for 12 weeks showed beneficial effects on cognitive performance in older adults. Our results suggest that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise improves cognitive disorders in older adults via modulating stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Hormone therapy is the most effective available treatment but is not without risk if taken long term, and is sometimes contraindicated; for example, in women with a personal or family history of breast cancer, which is the most common female cancer worldwide. Other treatment alternatives are not as efficacious, can cause side effects, and/or are not widely available. A new, effective, targeted treatment could therefore benefit millions of women worldwide. This became possible to investigate after accumulated evidence from both animal and human models implicated heightened signaling of a hypothalamic neuropeptide together with its receptor (neurokinin B/NK3R) in the etiology of sex-steroid-deficient vasomotor symptoms. Four clinical trials of three chemically distinct oral NK3R antagonists for the treatment of menopausal flushes have since completed and published, which consistently demonstrate efficacy and tolerability of these agents. These suggest great promise to change practice in the future if ongoing further larger-scale studies of longer duration confirm the same; as, estrogen exposure will no longer be required to effectively and safely treat vasomotor symptoms.",2020,11,02,Climacteric,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists; hot flushes; menopause; novel therapeutics; vasomotor symptoms,Prague,J K,"Macleod Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, UK",none

Infertility caused by POI used to be considered absolute, with infertility treatment having little or no value. Generally, it has been thought that medicine can provide little service to these patients. The etiology of POI has been found to be genetic, chromosomal, and autoimmune. In addition, the increasing numbers of cancer survivors are candidates for iatrogenic POI, along with patients who have undergone ovarian surgery, especially laparoscopic surgery. Over 50 genes are known to be causally related to POI, and the disease course of some cases has been clarified, but in most cases, the genetic background remains unexplained, suggesting that more genes associated with the etiology of POI need to be discovered. Thus, in most cases, the genetic background of POI has not been clarified. Monosomy X is well known to manifest as Turner's syndrome and is associated with primary amenorrhea, but recent studies have shown that some women with numerical abnormalities of the X chromosome can have spontaneous menstruation up to their twenties and thirties, and some even conceive. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended for women with POI from many perspectives. It alleviates vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms and prevents bone loss and cardiovascular disease. POI has been reported to reduce quality of life and life expectancy, and HRT may help improve both. Most of the problems that may occur with HRT in postmenopausal women do not apply to women with POI; thus, in POI, HRT should be considered physiological replacement of estrogen (+progesterone). This review describes some new approaches to infertility treatment in POI patients that may lead to new treatments for POI, along with the development of more sensitive markers of secondary/preantral follicles and genetic diagnosis.",2021,02,25,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,autoimmunity; cardiovascular disease; chromosomal abnormality; genetics; hormone replacement therapy (HRT); ovulation induction; premature ovarian insufficiency (POI); vasomotor symptoms,Ishizuka,Bunpei,"Rose Ladies Clinic, Tokyo, Japan",none

In mice, genetic ablation of <i>Gpr37l1</i> causes sex-dependent effects; female mice lacking <i>Gpr37l1</i> (GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup>) have a modest but significant elevation in blood pressure, while male GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice are more susceptible to cardiovascular dysfunction following angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Given that this receptor is highly expressed in the brain, we hypothesize that the cardiovascular phenotype of GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice is due to changes in autonomic regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. To investigate this, radiotelemetry was employed to characterize baseline cardiovascular variables in GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice of both sexes compared to wildtype controls, followed by power spectral analysis to quantify short-term fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate attributable to alterations in autonomic homeostatic mechanisms. Additionally, pharmacological ganglionic blockade was performed to determine vasomotor tone, and environmental stress tests were used to assess whether cardiovascular reactivity was altered in GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We observed that mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in female GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wildtype counterparts, but was unchanged in male GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> genotype had a statistically significant positive chronotropic effect on heart rate across both sexes when analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Power spectral analysis of these data revealed a reduction in power in the heart rate spectrum between 0.5 and 3 Hz in female GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice during the diurnal active period, which indicates that GPR37L1<sup>-/-</sup> mice may have impaired cardiac vagal drive.

It is assumed that the reduction in BP following CSD administration is associated to decreases in cardiac output (CO) and peripheral resistance, reflecting cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic tone, respectively. Surprisingly, this has not been characterized experimentally in mice, despite the extensive use of this animal model in cardiovascular research. We hypothesize that a specific dose of CSD can selectively block the sympathetic vasomotor tone. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of different doses of CSD (intraperitoneal) on BP and heart rate (HR) using telemetry, and on CO using echocardiography. BP and HR in normotensive C57Bl/6J mice reduced to a similar extent by all CSD doses tested (1-6 mg/kg). CSD at 6 mg/kg also reduced CO without affecting left ventricular stroke volume or fractional shortening. On the other hand, lower doses of CSD (1 and 2 mg/kg) produced significantly larger BP and HR reductions in DOCA-salt-induced hypertensive mice, indicating a greater neurogenic BP response. In addition, all doses of CSD reduced CO in hypertensive mice. Our data suggest that the BP response to CSD in mice likely reflects reduced CO and vasomotor sympathetic tone. We conclude that CSD can be used to assess the neurogenic contribution to BP in mice but may not be appropriate for specifically estimating vasomotor sympathetic tone.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

While it is well known that carotid and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors modulate sympathetic vasomotor and parasympathetic cardiac neural autonomic drive, to avoid excessive fluctuations in vascular tone and maintain intravascular volume, there is increasing recognition that baroreceptors also modulate a wide range of non-cardiovascular physiological responses via projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract to regions of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord. These projections regulate pain perception, sleep, consciousness, and cognition. In this article, we summarize the physiology of baroreceptor pathways and responses to baroreceptor activation with an emphasis on the mechanisms influencing cardiovascular function, pain perception, consciousness, and cognition. Understanding baroreceptor-mediated effects on cardiac and extra-cardiac autonomic activities will further our understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple common clinical conditions, such as chronic pain, disorders of consciousness (e.g., abnormalities in sleep-wake), and cognitive impairment, which may result in the identification and implementation of novel treatment modalities. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

However, in a considerable proportion (30-50%) of patients undergoing coronary angiography, obstructive CAD is excluded. Thus, functional mechanisms may be involved in determining myocardial ischemia and should be investigated. In particular, coronary vasomotor disorders both at epicardial and at microvascular level may play a crucial role, but a definitive diagnosis of these disorders can at times be difficult, given the transience of symptoms, and often requires the use of coronary provocative tests. Of importance, these tests may provide relevant information on the pathogenic mechanism of myocardial ischemia, allowing physicians to tailor the therapies of their patients. Furthermore, several studies underscored the important prognostic information deriving from the use of coronary provocative tests. Nevertheless, their use in clinical practice is currently limited and mainly restricted to specialized centers, with only a minority of patients receiving a benefit from this diagnostic approach. In this review, we explain the pathophysiological bases for the use of provocative tests, along with their clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications.",2020,12,13,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,Coronary microvascular dysfunction; Myocardial ischemia; Precision medicine; Provocative test; Vasospastic angina,Niccoli,Giampaolo,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A",none

2568,none,none,none,"MHT: How and how long in healthy women above 65? <b>Abstract.</b> In Europe, women spend more than one third of their lifetime in the postmenopause which is characterized by chronic estrogen deficiency. About 80 % of them suffer from vasomotor symptoms which can last for up to twelve years or more. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) with sexual steroids is the most effective treatment resulting in a reduction of hot flushes and an improvement of quality of life. Today, a large proportion of women is not treated adequately as demonstrated by a marked decline of MHT-prescriptions. The postmenopause is not only associated with climacteric symptoms, but also with long-term risks, such as cardiovascular events, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction or diabetes mellitus. Numerous studies have shown beneficial effects of MHT on many of these diseases and on mortality, provided that treatment has been initiated close to the onset of menopause. Accordingly, some investigators have postulated a possible role of MHT in primary prevention. However, concerning long-term beneficial effects of MHT in women beyond the age of 65 years, the optimal duration of MHT is still unknown. Consequently, the duration of MHT should always be planned individually after thorough consideration of potential benefits and risks in agreement with the patient. Especially with advancing age transdermal application of estrogens seems to be the best option because of less vascular risks. There is no apodictic limitation of maximal duration of MHT.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

We previously reported that activation of the P2Y11 receptor (P2Y11R) in human dendritic cells, cardiofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes was protective against hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) lesions. In this study, we investigated the role of P2Y11R signaling in vascular dysfunction. P2Y11R activity was modulated using its pharmacological agonist NF546 and antagonist NF340. Rat aortic rings were exposed to angiotensin II (AngII) and evaluated for their vasomotor response. The P2Y11R agonist NF546 reduced AngII-induced vascular dysfunction by promoting EC-dependent vasorelaxation, through an increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and reduced AngII-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release; these effects were prevented by the use of the P2Y11R antagonist NF340. Human vascular SMCs and ECs were subjected to AngII or H/R simulation in vitro. P2Y11R agonist modulated vasoactive factors in human ECs, that is, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and endothelin-1, reduced SMC proliferation and prevented the switch towards a synthetic phenotype.

Indeed, E4 significantly improves vasomotor and genito-urinary menopausal symptoms and prevents bone demineralization. Compared with other estrogens, E4 was found to have limited effects on coagulation factors in the liver of women allowing to expect less thrombotic events. To fully delineate its clinical potential, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of E4 on metabolic disorders. Here, we studied the pathophysiological consequences of a Western diet (42% kcal fat, 0.2% cholesterol) in ovariectomized female mice under chronic E4 treatment. We showed that E4 reduces body weight gain and improves glucose tolerance in both C57Bl/6 and <i>LDLR</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. To evaluate the role of hepatic estrogen receptor (ER) α in the preventive effect of E4 against obesity and associated disorders such as atherosclerosis and steatosis, mice harboring a hepatocyte-specific ERα deletion (LERKO) were crossed with <i>LDLR</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results demonstrated that, whereas liver ERα is dispensable for the E4 beneficial actions on obesity and atheroma, it is necessary to prevent steatosis in mice. Overall, these findings suggest that E4 could prevent metabolic, hepatic, and vascular disorders occurring at menopause, extending the potential medical interest of this natural estrogen as a new hormonal treatment.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Estetrol prevents obesity, steatosis, and atherosclerosis in mice fed a Western diet.

Here, we studied the pathophysiological consequences of a Western diet (42% kcal fat, 0.2% cholesterol) in ovariectomized female mice under chronic E4 treatment. We showed that E4 reduces body weight gain and improves glucose tolerance in both C57Bl/6 and <i>LDLR</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. To evaluate the role of hepatic estrogen receptor (ER) α in the preventive effect of E4 against obesity and associated disorders such as atherosclerosis and steatosis, mice harboring a hepatocyte-specific ERα deletion (LERKO) were crossed with <i>LDLR</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results demonstrated that, whereas liver ERα is dispensable for the E4 beneficial actions on obesity and atheroma, it is necessary to prevent steatosis in mice.

Angina pectoris affects approximately 112 million people globally. Up to 70% of patients undergoing invasive angiography do not have obstructive coronary artery disease, more common in women than in men, and a large proportion have INOCA as a cause of their symptoms. INOCA patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs that are often misdiagnosed as non-cardiac leading to under-diagnosis/investigation and under-treatment. INOCA can result from heterogeneous mechanism including coronary vasospasm and microvascular dysfunction and is not a benign condition.

2670,none,none,none,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary small vessel disease presenting with migraine, mood and cognitive disorders, focal neurological deficits, recurrent ischemic attacks, lacunar infarcts and brain white matter changes. As they age, CADASIL patients invariably develop cognitive impairment and subcortical dementia. CADASIL is caused by missense mutations in the <i>NOTCH3</i> gene resulting in a profound cerebral vasculopathy affecting primarily arterial vascular smooth muscle cells, which target the microcirculation and perfusion. Based on a thorough review of morphological lesions in arteries, veins, and capillaries in CADASIL, we surmise that arteriolar and capillary pericyte damage or deficiency appears a key feature in the pathogenesis of the disease. This may affect critical pericyte-endothelial interactions causing stroke injury and vasomotor disturbances. Changes in microvascular permeability due to perhaps localized blood-brain barrier alterations and pericyte secretory dysfunction likely contribute to delayed neuronal as well as glial cell death. Moreover, pericyte-mediated cerebral venous insufficiency may explain white matter lesions and the dilatation of Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces typical of CADASIL. The postulated central role of the pericyte offers some novel approaches to the study and treatment of CADASIL and enable elucidation of other forms of cerebral small vessel diseases and subcortical vascular dementia.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

The lifetime prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice the prevalence in males and amounts to 18 - 21 %. The menopausal transition is a ""window of increased vulnerability"" and might trigger a depressive disorder. In this period, the risk to get depressive is 1.5 - 4 times higher than in the premenopause, particularly in women suffering from vasomotor symptoms and presenting additional risk factors for mood disorders and depression. Depression in climacteric women is still underestimated and has to be actively looked for by family doctors and gynaecologists. Oestrogens modulate the metabolism of serotonin and noradrenalin, as do SSRI / SNRI and antidepressants, and influence therefore mood, mental function and cognition. In the menopausal transition, there is suggestive evidence that Oestrogen therapy can improve mood, anxiety and depression. In peri- and early postmenopausal women with climacteric vasomotor symptoms, Oestrogens might be considered as a first-line treatment for depressive symptoms. However, Oestrogens do not improve depression in the late postmenopause.

2676,none,none,none,"Evidence-based Facts of non-hormonal treatment of menopausal symptom <b>Abstract.</b> Menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats can have a great impact on quality of life. As first line, hormonal therapy with estrogens in combination with progestins is used, and shows beneficial effects on these symptoms. Some women, however, have contraindications against hormonal therapy or do not wish to take hormones at all. In these women, alternative treatments are needed to treat vasomotor symptoms. Pharmacologic substances like antidepressants, anticonvulsants or antihypertensive drugs show a significant reduction of these symptoms in menopausal women. Phytopharmaceutical products may show beneficial effects but study designs often do not fulfil strict scientific criteria. Furthermore, dosage and composition of the products may differ considerably. Best data are available for isoflavons and extracts of cimicifuga racemosa. Other alternative therapies like yoga, exercise, hypnosis and acupuncture showed promising results in small studies and may be recommended individually.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none
2677,none,none,none,"The critical closing pressure (CrCP) of the cerebral vasculature is the arterial blood pressure (ABP) at which cerebral blood flow (CBF) ceases. Because the ABP of preterm infants is low and close to the CrCP, there is often no CBF during diastole. Thus, estimation of CrCP may become clinically relevant in preterm neonates. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound has been used to estimate CrCP in preterm infants. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a continuous, noninvasive optical technique that measures microvascular CBF. Our objective was to compare and validate CrCP measured by DCS versus TCD ultrasound. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in 13 neonatal piglets, and CBF was measured continuously by both modalities. CrCP was calculated using a model of cerebrovascular impedance, and CrCP determined by the two modalities showed good correlation by linear regression, median r <sup>2</sup> = 0.8 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.71-0.87), and Bland-Altman analysis showed a median bias of -3.5 (IQR -4.6 to -0.28). This is the first comparison of CrCP determined by DCS versus TCD ultrasound in a neonatal piglet model of hemorrhagic shock. The difference in CrCP between the two modalities may be due to differences in vasomotor tone within the microvasculature of the cerebral arterioles versus the macrovasculature of a major cerebral artery.",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none

We telemetrically examined the time courses of systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and the middle-frequency (MF) component obtained from the power spectral analysis of SBP variability as a vasomotor sympathetic index. We also investigated the baroreflex sensitivity to phentolamine, an α-adrenoceptor antagonist, and the SBP and HR responses to a low ambient temperature (LT; 9.0 ± 0.2°C) exposure, a sympathetic stimulant. Rats exposed to cast immobilization exhibited mechanical allodynia lasting for at least 10 weeks after cast removal in the calf area (skin and muscle) of the bilateral hind limbs. Under resting conditions, the SBP, HR, and MF components were significantly increased during cast immobilization (all p < 0.001). Following cast removal, these parameters gradually decreased and within 1 week reached lower than baseline levels, lasting for over 10 weeks.
